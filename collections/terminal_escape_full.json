But you don't know that, you just hear some distorted rock 'n roll and you get drunk and wild. And that's totally fine, because that's what you are supposed to hear. I hear bits of several '90s acts seeping through this five song banger, but mostly these St. Louis monkeys dish out high caliber grungy punk...and I like it. \"Death Rattles\" is that track for this guy, if only because going out on a fast note was a really good idea.

With just one song approaching the two minute mark, THE PESSIMISTS deftly place pop sensibilities and stark, driving post punk hooks into these tiny little bursts. The vocalists trade stoic barks and adolescent melodies, the rhythm section is rock solid in their repetition while the guitar lingers lingers in the fog, occasionally sweeping in to blow over the rest of the sound. Every song is a hit (in the world that we all wish we lived in), and their ability to take casual ownership of well traveled sonic territory is uncanny. There are pretty obvious references all over this self titled cassette (which combines tracks from 2015's In The Beginning There Was.... and the Six Songs EP on Nada Nada) - yet all of the sounds belong to these two recordings as if they were reincarnated in their intended form. I'm happy to have seen them once, even once was magic. As you start your day, know that \"Daily Suicide\" and \"Doomed Forever\" are the two songs that will guide you.\u00a0THE PESSIMISTS https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjv_v8EAn_SwJg04XKY6f6Tg8HnTu09iPK0youE9eSJaT2s4pvXJZ9dbdxwgWEutIbr9KojeQFqr1jiBpkpabmsetjvu-lg_QltZ5Y4iPmY_obV3sJ3C3NniTvPtyUGO5JG3dzZtKgE-T0jkdAV3MQSWn9OrTi_4L9vDALNWcVSHh0L__ykqeY6cc6PFg=s799 https://theepessimists.bandcamp.com/ https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2016/06/the-pessimists.html https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg4UdsMSgS-4tK42ld6ZDw0ehyduuFZ1x_kb9BgneoLCdbL11G3ZHuHJSlfQXJAf7CxBb3rjQp_2gv9OpGtwFVN6loKjDj71vSSEj9DaMvMf7-T4OjKqANurX2_dhG5yZkmZmAkJVK00RwItKA02lPZFjqyrS_6LNsX_mAVEGLEeru5AMOlVCJwGq8m7w=s509"

Their sound is almost goth but occasionally almost anarcho punk, the vocals are just a hair off of what could be considered beautiful and teeter on the edge of being super annoying at times, they don't swing enough to dance to, but they aren't pretentious enough to be true dark goth freaks. There are rhythms that conjure up mental images of afternoons wasted at Renaissance Fair(e)s....and still I fall into the \"love it\" category. \"Merry Go Round Games\" with its flute taking the lead and the tempo build up at the end before that borders on some Fiddler On The Roof shit before the band chants and picks up the tempo for \"Geda\" to close this short three song offering. I can't tell you why I like them, because every descriptor I can offer just makes them sound like pretentious drivel...but it's fukkn great. I've shared two other demos on these pages, both were received to mixed reviews (Tribal Dance is one that I have no reservations about - it's truly excellent). This short demo is a live recording from 1987 - and while I'm pretty sure that BTPO benefited greatly from the tools that a studio setting offered....? I'll still take it.\u00a0 LIVE '87 http://terminalescape.blogspot.com/search?q=bliss+pocket http://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2012/02/bliss-pocket-opera.html"

I promise), but I might like this fifth demo even better. STATEMENT were a solo anarcho/activist project who spanned the musical spectrum over the course of their existence, and this collection of post punk and proto-indie oddities manages to capture slight bits of all of the weirdness that one Patrick Rat Poole conjured up over the years (presumably in his bedroom). \"Strike Back\" is the standout track, though this tape is so all over the place that there will probably be a different focus on every listen. Animal and human rights, well thought out politics in general, and generally catchy ditties make this 22 track cassette mandatory, and while the title reads Not For Punks, I would suggest that it should be for punks...but perhaps modern punks place the value of sound and status over that of content? Maybe STATEMENT was right after all. NOT FOR PUNKS The internet tells me that the man responsible for these quirky and out there bedroom anarcho sounds also did stints in CRACKED COP SKULLS and RIOT/CLONE which, oddly, makes sense. And yeah, I know that I linked this post to two older posts with dead links - I'll fix them really really soon.

A no fidelity live track from WEYES BLOOD flows in to some kind of distant acoustic ramble by MOUNTAINS AND RAINBOWS before ANDREW COLTRANE delivers a damaged layer guitar raga. A deranged grunge dirge from LIVE NOT ON EVIL and then BODY HEAD drops a two chord depression missive. QUILT BOY are the most energetic act on the tape, and their primal garage rock stomp features a guitar that plays chords with such ferocity that it feels like the whole damn thing is a solo....and then THE INTENDED bring your journey to a (merciful?) end with a two minute wash of throbbing harsh noise.

This is what happens when a band has a great idea that is actually as good as they thought it was going to be when they were drunk. FUCKED UP MIX TAPE II NO STATIK east coast/midwest tour starts tonight in Alexandria, Virginia. Come visit us, or visit Prank and snag our new record...either way you will be a winner. //1.bp.blogspot.com/-eiEF7OY0X60/TvrLPMGaVAI/AAAAAAAACLw/5a_jq0G6y-U/s1600/fucked+up+mix+copy.jpg http://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2011/01/fucked-up.html //2.bp.blogspot.com/-wkWd1sHTdas/TvrQk6kQuwI/AAAAAAAACMI/hJgHuF1yARI/s1600/DC.jpg http://www.prankrecords.com/"

Killer Israeli hardcore, punk and post punk on a mix tape from the early '90s. The two aforementioned bands along with RAMPAGE (somewhere between 7 SECONDS and GRIMPLE), USELESS ID (probably the best known '90s band from Israel if only because they were able to tour extensively), NOT4SALE (the stinkers of the mix...I mean, it's a homemade regional sampler from the '90s so how is there not going to be a funk/ska band?), tough metallic HC from PREDATOR and a band called ETHOS who steal the whole fukkn show. What if a band took the same anarcho influences that ignited SUBMISSION HOLD but then took the whole thing in a driving proto-goth direction? I dare say that ETHOS will be the best band you hear for the first time today - even though there are only three tracks and the recording leaves more than a little to be desired.

It might be just the approach that sets both of these outfits apart from the voluminous nonsensical anti-punk Wheelchair Full Of Old Men catalog, but it might also be the result.\u00a0 Remember that the US underground was just a few years removed from Confusion Is Sex, and experimentation was rife in the face of the same four hardcore riffs that had been blasted on repeat for the preceding eight years in the American Midwest. In this case, that experimentation is a decidedly non-musical split that falls somewhere in the chasm formed by the separation of NY No Wave and 1970s Kraut Rock and raises a drunken, defiant middle finger to both while jamming some dub records on the way down. But it's....good. Casually chaotic and gloriously monotonous, GAY FLORISTS and WIGGLY WIGGLY AND OFF WITH MY FACE share an approach (and if we're being honest, probably more than one or two members) that might have been a blueprint for further experimentation.

The brainchild of John Gossard, who was responsible for WEAKLING, perhaps the most quietly influential Bay Area black metal band ever, DISPIRIT dole out atmospheric and bleak black metal steeped in melancholy and doom (the subgenre\u00a0and\u00a0the emotion), combining the pace of Gossard's other notable act ASUNDER with whitewashed guitar melodies and genuine despair. The tempo doesn't increase beyond an excruciating crawl until twenty minutes into the demo, and even then the result is an increased focus on the melody...trying to find the band through the severe lack of fidelity. But the poor recording sets the mood, and I think it's important as an introduction - nothing about DISPIRIT is pretty. It took me almost two years to see the band live, and as much as I was prepared to be blown away, I left the show underwhelmed and wondering if the hype had slipped through the band's grasp...and then I listened to this tape. Tortured sounds, to be sure (and the next time I saw them it was everything I had hoped it would be).

This time the hardcore jams come from Americaland (except AKUTT INNGGELSE, some random Scandinavians tacked onto the end of the tape who totally slay) - PSYCHO (Boston), LOVE CANAL (Los Angeles), THE DRILLS (Seattle), EAT THE RICH (San Jose), Terminal Escape alumni THE UNEXPECTED (New Jersey), SUBURBAN DECAY (more Jersey), legendary scorchers from DETENTION, and DISORDERLY CONDUCT from Florida. Lots of raw and likely live recordings, perfectly suited for blasting at top fukkn volume because you are a punk rocker. The DETENTION songs blew my mind when I first heard them courtesy of ILLEGITIMATE SONS guitarist Dan, and they are just as powerful today. And yes, I know that the EAT THE RICH cover of \"Electric Funeral\" totally blows. I'M BUCK NAKED Worth noting: I'm assuming that the band WHITE PRIDE is indeed a white pride band, and yeah I think that's somewhere between stupid and offensive, but 25 years later it seems silly to edit them out of the tape, especially since their songs are super catchy. No sense in starting a dialogue about the musical merits of '80s nazi shitheads, since they can all get fukkd and probably spend their adult days pulling swing shifts at Best Buy to support their cross eyed aryan offspring. You gotta sell a shitload of Lil Wayne CDs and Call Of Duty games and kiss a lot of your bosses ass to support a one bedroom apartment full of blond haired rugrats, so my heart goes out to them. //2.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/TUutHitI-RI/AAAAAAAABg4/bv7rEYlv544/s1600/buck+naked+cover+copy.jpg"

Word came in as bands were loading out at the end of the night that they had broken down and were stranded with the dude from Conspiracy Evolve at a hotel in Kettleman City. Not wanting to miss seeing these ragers in the flesh, and knowing how much it must suck to think about spending half of your tour stranded in the Central Valley, I drove south instead of driving home, and found myself knocking on a hotel room door around 4am. Four excited dudes opened the door and asked with a mix of curiosity and excitement, \"Gilman Street?\" The language barrier was severe, but eventually they understood that they had, in fact, completely missed playing at Gilman with SPAZZ (which, in the year 199whatever, was pretty much the holy grail for a fastcore band from Japan) and so we took a short nap before heading back to San Francisco for an afternoon show at Mission Records. That 20 minutes was well worth the late night run, as CURTAIN RAIL were a dervish of stops and starts and manic blasts with warp speed death metal riffs sneaking into their brand of Japanese Hardcore, just a complete and total assault in every way. And then I drove back to LA to send those dudes home.... CURTAIN RAIL One of the guys would go on to play in COFFINS (which perhaps help explain the metal tinge to those riffs), but the CURTAIN RAIL are just as deadly 20 years later.

Vocals are still the focal point, stark shouts that are undeniably \"Eastern\" and give even the gnarliest riffs a cold, distant feeling. They made the progression by adding new elements to an already distinct sound and without turning away from their punk roots, leaving sonic archaeologists with a trove of tapes and records that feel like they came from another time and another world. I say \"mostly\" a collection of INVAZIJA recordings, because some nice punk in the past filled up the rest of the tape with Ukrainian and Latvian punk so the Lithuanians wouldn't get lonely. Ukraine's PICISMO taken from 1997/98 demos - discordant and damaged hardcore tonnage that related to, but sounds completely different from their neighbors on the first side. Gruff vocals and churning riffs a la UNSANE but with a propensity for tearing loose in a DBeat fury. Yet another example of what can happen when bands develop their sound organically (hint: it's almost always better). Then three more bonus cuts from Latvia's KURU KSIETRA fill up the end of the tape; rapid fire proto-fastcore delivered with adolescent honesty. More compilations, more collections, more underground and under-appreciated DIY hardcore punk.

Dude gave me a sick demo, but couldn't come to the show because \"work sucks\" (feel your pain, buddy). The vaguely interesting part is that he put it in the merch area, where no one from our band set foot all night, and since the outside of the small package read \"Terminal Escape,\" it's only because someone got nosy and read the note that the tape ever made it to me... and I'm glad it did.

Most of these qualities are difficult to define and often unquantifiable, just as much as they are undeniable. It's the sound of utter desperation (sometimes passion) in the vocals, the off the rails lurch of musicians barely staying inside of the lines and the electricity from a unit firing in complete unison. It doesn't always translate into the most advanced music, but it often results in some of the best. TORTURA are a hardcore punk band, but trying to describe their sound without mentioning these intangibles would be doing them a great disservice. There are only four songs on last year's self titled demo, but the band is searing, focused and true. Spanish language vocals suggest an intensity even greater than the music conveys, and moments of melody (such as \"No Entienden\") suggest a vision more even more poignant than this short cassette can convey.

Like one with a catchy chorus and a bridge, maybe even a few tasty guitar licks....and there's gotta be a singer that I can try to sing along with (and fail) when no one is listening. All noise all the time.....? Well that just means that the noise doesn't really have any oomph anymore, right? Enter Singapore's DAILY RITUAL. Actually, this entry is a couple of years old, and they've since released an EP, a full length on Sabotage/4490, and a recent split with THE STOPS. The kids have been busy, and they are cranking out the stuff that I want.

Dave brought me this GAS CHAMBER demo, and holy shit even with his endorsement as a preparatory tool, I was still devastated - these ten songs clearly come from another planet. Harnessing the power of NO COMMENT and other early powerviolence brutality, GAS CHAMBER put sounds through a filter that is purely their own, and present these ten tracks of uncompromising pain and fury. The guitar alone manages to hold these songs together, while the bass acts as the lead instrument and the drums go off on nonsensical and ferocious tangents but somehow manage to lead the songs to their merciful end. And speaking of tangents, the last half of \"Comfort Food\" comes completely out of left field, and serves as a subtle nudge to remind you that these dudes are way\u00a0over your head. The lyrics range from agonizing to nihilistic, and fit the songs perfectly. This is rust belt frustration with CROSSED OUT delivery, a fucking perfect demo tape. GAS CHAMBER Update: After the recording of this demo, Dave moved back to Buffalo and joined GAS CHAMBER on guitar. The\u00a0GAS CHAMBER album \"Hemorrhaging Light\" is currently available on Iron Lung Records. It is incredible. //2.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/S90wy2A3KtI/AAAAAAAAA34/JlU9h3qm_9Y/s1600/gas+chamber+cover.jpg http://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2010/02/cages.html //1.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/S900UdncMmI/AAAAAAAAA4A/-sWldpa8DLM/s1600/gas+chamber+inside.jpg http://gaschamberhardcore.wordpress.com/ http://ironlungrecords.bigcartel.com/product/gas-chamber-hemorrhaging-light-lp-flexi-w-download"

Or I could talk about this tape in the context of the importance of mix tapes as a tool for networking and underground community. I could also discuss this tape as a representation of the progression of the punk scene/sound from the early Dischord days onward. Or perhaps I could just say that D.C. Today is a brilliantly crafted document of punk and hardcore from the area circa 1989. Bands that you may have heard of include MFD, AGENT 86, and SHUDDER TO THINK, but almost all of this shit is new to me - the east coast hardcore is crucial, the goth punk is completely legit, the ska is....well, it's ska but there are only two or three songs, and the sporadic between track phone interviews are fukkn brilliant little time capsules. I know Mike probably made this for a few friends, but I could not be happier that a cope made its way into my hands. Favorite jams: DESECRATION, GUT INSTINCT, STOMP, RANCID (not the one you are thinking of), THE WAIT and STRANGE BOUTIQUE. This is why mix tapes are fukkn great, especially 20+ years in the future. D.C. TODAY: A Compilation Tape Of Bands From Maryland/DC/Virginia As an extremely pleasant side note, I realized well into the digitization of these jams that the compiler was one Mike Straight, who was one of the first punks I met who really let me know (inadvertently, perhaps) that I was on the right path. The idea of putting snippets from telephone interviews in between choice tracks fits perfectly with my memories of Mike, and hearing his voice is a blast from my past (even though I probably didn't meet him until 5 years after he compiled this tape). Last I knew, Mike bought a house that was a glorified squat in Philadelphia and had convinced someone to give him money to go to school. Maybe my memory is incorrect (as is often the case), but someone should put me in touch with that dude because he was always super good to hang out with. //2.bp.blogspot.com/-ihnKOfT1WbI/UutIi0yHjVI/AAAAAAAAJbE/XY3niNaguus/s1600/dc+today+cover+copy.jpg"

CAPITAL GAIN became LIFE CYCLE and dropped a small handful of vinyl releases - available for cheap if you keep your eyes open, I guess because there's a weird perception that all post-'85 UK punk is crap or something? - but I've seen nothing about this four (and a half?) song recording. Like lumbering anarcho punks trying to make the leap into hi-charged metal punk and almost succeeding, CAPITAL GAIN are a brilliant example of the effort trumping the output. The output is great, SACRILEGE-esque vocals over mid-tempo bangers with tasty leads, but it's the level of sincerity that makes these tracks indispensable. So thanks for the email...

Rapid fire machine gun drums drive the assault and almost overshadow hints of '90s Japanese hardcore lurking amidst face melting fastcore. The breakdown \"Rebuild To Destroy\" alone is well worth the price of admission, and since the whole thing is so short, I've found myself listening over and over and looking forward to the quiet mood setting build up that takes the middle third of the song before that breakdown drops....you know it's coming, and it just makes you want to break stuff more when it arrives.

The riff does not come, but FEJHED's approach to electronic music is refreshing and captivating, and hopefully this will win over brainless hardcore mutants as well as potentially skeptical industrial fans, leery of a potential bandwagon jumper. This release doesn't assault you; it breathes, it reels you in, it flows through you, and it's almost soothing in a way that makes you feel subtly uncomfortable.

There's a dude in New Jersey named Ken who feels the same way, and he's putting together a goddamned oral history book about the whole fukkn scene and its far reaching influences. Also, Ken sings for a band called WALL BREAKER....and you can probably guess based on my lumbering preamble what kind of goods they deliver. Ripping, tough as nails and fast as fukk hardcore crosses everything off the checklist in just under seven and a half minutes. For example, you can see the breakdown in \"Damaged Mind\" coming from a mile away...then when it drops it still catches you by surprise and you want to break shit. This is far from a retro novelty act, WALL BREAKER feels it 100%, and the difference is palpable.\u00a0 WALL BREAKER https://wallbreakerstraightedge.bandcamp.com/"

A \"fan club\" cassette label focused on jazz freak and avant garde nuggets, this gem from Sonny and Linda Sharrock's SAVAGES ensemble is a perfect example of what Loathed Sound is capable of. A live in studio recording from 1974, the Sharrocks are joined by a rhythm section that settles into a pocket and then spends a quarter hour kicking their feet up and making themselves at home. Sonny's guitar is relatively subdued (especially for Sonny) and comes off like a casual band leader while Linda's voice drops in occasionally to make sure things stay out there....way out there. The 8+ minute trance inducing \"1953 Blue Boogie Children\" makes Savages mandatory, while \"Peaceful\" and \"Highlife\" present a bizarre big city sonic take on island life, with added haunting psychedelia.

They had just shipped a package that included RUN WESTY RUN's Hardly, Not Even and the first post-H\u00dcSKER D\u00dc offering from drummer Grant Hart, but all I wanted to know was when the rumored Bob Mould solo record was going to drop. Virgin would release Workbook a year later, and I listened to the 2541 12\" hundreds of times in that year...the innocent lilt and profoundly sad tone of Grant's voice was so much more evident than on even the mellowest H\u00dcSKER tracks, and his solo material just felt wholly real. I certainly devoured Mould's solo works as well, but there was something about 2541 and Intolerance that resonated powerfully with me. So when Grant's solo work evolved into NOVA MOB, I followed willingly, and I still spin 1991's\u00a0The Last Days Of Pompeii on the regular. Listening now with 2018 ears, I'm struck by the similarity to JAWBREAKER (especially in \"Wernher Von Braun\") that I never noticed before - probably because I never listened to JAWBREAKER. \"Admiral Of The Sea\" is worth the price of admission (in the case, free) on its - both versions of the song are striking and though I could never defend the dated drums and waka-waka guitars in the rock version, both are hopelessly endearing. Perhaps my affinity is clouded by history and perceived personal connection, but I think this record is pretty near perfect, and I was happy to spend $1 last year for this well loved cassette copy.

Think Jen Mace (NERVOUS TREND, NUCLEAR FAMILY) as a vocal comparison, while the Brad's guitar drives a focused outfit that takes the straight forward hardcore model and shoves it into a dark corner filled with '70s SF punk records and Greg Sage songsmith skills....the animal that emerges from that dark place is really good. There's a magic to a collection of well crafted tunes, and that's what this demo is full of - you know what you're getting as soon as you press play, and you keep listening because you know you like it.

I missed DIVORCE, I missed NO, I feel like I maybe played with GOAT SHANTY in Richmond in 2002, definitely saw AMERICAN CHEESEBURGER in Texas in the mid-'00s, then NO STATIK played with HARSH WORDS in Atlanta in 2013. The point is, it's not like we are tight or anything, but man, I really like that dude...and he hits the drums really good. Like, really good. I also missed SHAVED CHRIST, who claim one of the coolest monikers in modern hardcore and are complete rippers. Like TOTAL FURY crashing headlong into NEON CHRIST, these Georgia kids just fukkn burn through forced, disjointed and ultimately destructive US hardcore punk. No fancy studio work, just one screaming (loose) guitar track amped up higher than the rest of the mix and a crew of fellas banging the shit out of some punk because that's what they fukkn do. There was one six song EP that came shortly after this 2011 demo - I suggest seeking out that slab.

The songs are simply crafted, reminiscent of the more interesting early '90s college/alt greats, particularly on \"Sem Armas\" (I'm talking Rid Of Me-era PJ HARVEY, maybe TEENAGE FANCLUB). But here's the thing that really grabbed me:\u00a0Amor Duro listens like a complete and completely formed release, but \"Sem Armas\" is kinda the only song. There's the title track that opens the tape, but it comes off more like an introduction...an ominous sounding three note repetition with wailing vocals that border on BIRTHDAY PARTY caliber magnetism, and then after \"Sem Armas\" comes \"Fantasmas Sem Armas,\" an mystical re-imagination of the previous number that turns what was, as its roots, essentially a laid back indie/grunge number into a fully engrossing ambient journey. Portugal's VAIAPRAIA take the elements that feel and sound familiar and twist them into something completely different...but still completely familiar. The internet offers a deep hole that only makes VAIAPRAIA E AS RAINHAS DO BAILE more intriguing....so happy digging.\u00a0 AMOR DURO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcGfGx7Eocw https://vaiapraia.bandcamp.com/music"

It seems that the world just opens up a bit more when there are no bandmates and no conflicting opinions involved - and likely that's what's going on with MESSAGE TO THE RAT KING. Greg plays drums on a track, and there are a few other guests who stop by, but this Rat King messenger lives in one brain and it's kinda brilliant. \"Lagos\" conjures '80s college/indie in the form of a W/IFS demo outtake. Roy Wood's WIZZARD and Jay Reatard and SPACEMEN 3 and Sandinista all make make historical sonic visits, which really just reinforces that MESSAGE TO THE RAT KING is operating unfettered. If this weren't a one-off (and I'm just assuming that it is), then we would all be analyzing a genuinely advanced approach to punk creativity as the experiment continued and gained momentum. But what's more likely is that this one will go mostly unnoticed by all but a select (chosen?) few who recognize the brilliance and extoll the virtues to the uninterested masses.

So revel, Portland, revel in the 1-2-1-2 drums and the damaged ass vocals doing battle with themselves while the bass pounds through relentless bouncy eighth notes and the guitar is busy just being punk (listen to the title track, and take notes, it's a perfect punk guitar track). Like, really punk. Short bursts of noise and weirdness to keep you on your toes, but CHEMOS are as straightforward as it comes and still manage to sound like they are from outer space. You know this....you've just never heard it done like this. Perhaps because you've never heard it from the only band in Portland. \"Cleanly\" is the choice cut, but all five are winners.

(Whew. That was a lot.) I mean TRAGIC MULATTO and VICTIM'S FAMILY (both arguably on the front end of all this...), but I also mean MAD DRAMA and HICKEY, FALSE SACRAMENT and FAGGZ....everything that was something else, you dig?

If you don't know her, well...you probably should. Your world would be better for it if you did. You might be asking yourself what Karoline and CATAPULT have in common, and I admit that it probably seems like a bit of a stretch. Karoline is from Wisconsin, CATAPULT were from Las Vegas. Karoline is a person, CATAPULT were a band. BUT (and hear me out here): CATAPULT sound like they should have been on a Very Small Records comp (hell, they might have even been on one - there were so many bands on those comps, who can keep track?!), and Karoline had a lot of Very Small Records comps. CATAPULT sound kinda quirky and weird, and Karoline is pretty quirky and...well, you know what I mean. Did they ever know each other? I have no clue. But CATAPULT released this tape in 1997 and that's the year Karoline married me. I'm glad she did, and I hope she has a lot more birthdays. Also, I only remember this band from the LEAP FROM SOCIETY split, but this shit really holds up and I think I need to track down their records. So many things came out of the '90s that are addictive, totally unique and generally (also genuinely) amazing. Yeah...you know what I'm gonna say next, so I'll spare you.\u00a0SMORGASCORE!"

We briefly touched on cassette labels and how seemingly any band with a four song recording could start one. The regional compilations that were little more than mix tapes made by friends with crude hand-drawn covers. And the small towns that became flash pots of honest, earnest, pure and determined punk. Take a one hour minute bus ride and maybe you'd be in another small mining village with another youth center with another crew of a dozen kids making up another four bands and if they didn't all know each other then they all wanted to know each other and support each other with gigs and create an actually community out of a world that seemed overwhelmingly inhospitable in so many ways. Sure, most of those idealistic young adults have grown up or moved on or died, but that doesn't mean that the desperation of \"Self Defence\" or the pure idealism of \"Monarchy Needs Anarchy\" will knock you on your ass in 2021 even more than it probably did in 1984....because these kids from Nantyglo (that's in South Wales, population something less than 5,000) were just doing the damn thing. They were a part of something bigger than themselves.

Released in 1991 in a quantity of 50 (what the fuck?), these 15 songs are stripped of all the extras until nothing is left but pure punishment. It's not heavy, the riffs won't melt your face, it's not faster, it's not tighter....but it's fukkn right. I listened to to a few of the records after I pulled this bad boy out a few weeks ago, and I still think this is the best VOORHEES has ever sounded. This was reissued as a flexi sometime later in the '90s by Armed With Anger (because good luck getting one of the tapes), so you can own the physical manifestation of this magic if you're down to hunt.

That said, the 1000 MEXICANS track gets stuck in my head at least once a month (it's that damn bass line), THE RENEES are killer, THE THREE JOHNS track is mediocre but resulted in several of their records in my arsenal, and this JAZAWHAKI tune is as infectious as anything I can imagine.In addition, you get burners from THE GLOBAL INFANTALISTS, HAGAR THE WOMB (my first introduction was this track), THE MOODISTS, NIKKI SUDDEN, and THE RENEES (\"Drink Problem\" seemed so racy as a 16 year old...) among many others. I think the motivation for this comp was financial, as British Airwaves seems to have been compiled and released by a label hoping to break UK post punk/new wave acts into the US market, but I can't really see anything here that we Americans ever gave a shit about aside from NEW MODEL ARMY....though this is still my favorite NEW MODEL ARMY jam.

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on August 25, 2015 Description from Terminal Escape: I first saw MARSHSTEPPER at a place called The Lab in San Francisco a few years ago. I don't remember why I wanted to go to the show, because I didn't really know anything about the band, but I had convinced myself that it was gonna be a thing...so I went. I didn't know anyone there, and it was a big weird open art gallery, so I sat in the corner and drank....and I waited. A long time. And nothing happened. I texted Karoline something to the effect of \"I am an idiot. Why am I waiting for something to happen? There's no way that whatever is going to happen is going to be good enough to justify all this waiting once it actually happens, which might be quite a while from now.\" And still I waited. Alone. I mean, there was one dude that I kinda knew, and we said \"hi\" but that was it because he had actual friends there....and by \"there\" I mean The Lab in San Francisco, where exactly nothing was happening. Apparently there was a fellow from AVON LADIES in the band, because I saw him walk in with some equipment, but we had only met that one time in that really hot warehouse (I mean, most things in Phoenix are hot) so after we said \"hello\" I just kept waiting. I went to the store and bought two beers, drank one of them on the way back from the store and then went inside with the other one....and I waited. Seriously, either I was really early, or the show was really late, because I waited for a long ass time. No way a show could be good enough to justify the waiting, but I kept waiting because of a thing called FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). What if it was really good? What if it was worth the wait? So I waited....and then a band played. By \"band\" I really mean \"dude with a laptop computer and he was called JOCK CLUB and it was pretty cool (actually very cool) so I kept waiting, encouraged by optimism and FOMO. And then it got dark. And there were candles. And there were robes. And there were naked men. And it was transcendent. Perfect. Awesome. Everything I hoped plus so many things that I never dreamed. It was the thing you wait for. It was the thing you are afraid of missing. It was the reason that FOMO exists - because you do not want to miss what I saw. I've tried to see MARSHSTEPPER several times since, and every time something has gotten in the way. I like to think that this is the universe telling me that I saw the perfect show, and that I do not need to see another. Maybe, for once, the universe is right.

GALGET's uncompromising fastcore attack is a breath of fresh air (and fellow band folks - listen to how the change the presentation of three chord riffs to make them into entirely \"different\" parts...far from a lazy way to make songs, I think of it as economical and kinda genius), and it just sounds like they are partying. The non-cover for MINOR THREAT's cover of that WIRE banger to close the side is perhaps and accidental harbinger of what's to come on the IKARIYA EIICHI side...a blown out screwed version of BAD BRAINS' \"Leaving Babylon\" and a truly bizarre non-take of \"Pay To Cum.\" Bear in mind that this is a band who also dropped a Japanese language proto-dub psychedelic version of \"(Take Me Home) Country Roads,\" so reinterpretations seem to be the name of the game.

The divisions between East and West Bay that permeated most of the '90s has partially dissolved, and you had freaks from the Tri-Valley jamming in bands with West Bay Coalition OGs. Shows in Santa Cruz and San Rafael were not an anomaly, and were often packed with hungry kids while San Jose shows seemed like they were damn near always banging. The Peninsula was still weird, as a crew of emo kids started to come into their own in the shadow of NO LESS and PLUTOCRACY...we would see UNDER A DYING SUN and DEADBODIESEVERYWHERE in the same weekend. TIME IN MALTA played with TRAGEDY in San Francisco because it made sense - hell, ICE 9 had played with HIS HERO IS GONE just a few years earlier in Indiana, so why not? And at the center of it all? Mission Records in SF and 924 Gilman in Berkeley. The Bay had finally gotten (back) to point where people just came to shows....not that it didn't matter who the bands were, but there were just so many good fukkn shows that you knew it was worth gambling. And there were kids everywhere...high school kids screaming the words, high school kids starting their own bands. It was awesome. I know that hardcore now is every bit as vibrant as it was then and I'm not some \"living in the past\" relic,\u00a0but perhaps with advancing age comes the distance...and of course it feels more intense and more relevant when you're always in the mix, right? So sometimes when I attend (or play) a show and I find myself somewhat reserved and/or reflective, I come home and I blast something like this.\u00a0 SKATIN' FOR SATAN Y'all know Tony Molina, right? A decade or so after this 5+ minute collection of relentless blasting teenage rage, the singer for DYSTROPHY was featured on some NPR \"must hear\" new artists or some shit. And as much as I confess that Dissed and Dismissed is worth the hype, watching the trainwreck that was Tony's current power violence project HEALER try to set up and tune their instruments was waaaaay sicker. DYSTROPHY live set from Mission Records at the end of 2001 has been up on Escape Is Terminal for a couple of years...link is still live and worth your time.\u00a0 https://tonymolina650.bandcamp.com/album/dissed-and-dismissed http://escapeisterminal.blogspot.com/2016/06/dystrophy.html"

Buzz (SHOTWELL) and Janelle (PANTY RAID, TOURETTES, Tales Of Blarg) had started a summer band so they could help their friend move across country. The plan: make a demo, book some shows, drop friend off, leisurely vacation their way back to the west coast. Pretty chill plan...until the van dies in Wisconsin Dells and the hotel says you're scumbags and you can't stay there anymore and sleeping in a ditch starts getting old., Their bandmate/s and taggers along had already gotten rides to Milwaukee, and I drove to The Dells to collect Buzz, Janelle and their belongings from a van in a gas station parking lot at 3am...we left the van there (sans license plates) and brought them to our pad to work on a new plan. They only stayed with us for a couple of nights, their road crew was soon reunited and everyone started trickling home on their own. That was the summer I met the brilliant and (still) inspiring Melissa Shakes, and my second encounter with Brontez (who re-introduced himself by mentioning how excited he was to turn 18 in a few months so he could start his career as a porn star), but I never saw SUBURBAN BITCH play a show.\u00a0 SUBURBAN BITCH The sound?

Angular, weird post/anarcho punk with some of the most gloriously awkward vocals I've come across. Bass and drums hold the songs together while the guitar does....well, it's doing something awesome. And those vocals....shouted in bursts of apparent hyper-dimentia and nasal congestion. They are weird and nowhere near what is traditionally considered \"good,\" but that's what makes them so fukkn good. Atonal and in your face while still seeming distant, not unlike the band as a whole. I like this tape a lot...top track: \"Brick Fire.\" SAINT LORENA //3.bp.blogspot.com/-GgTMfJh88sI/VekjmUrs4aI/AAAAAAAANEc/_AxA7Ok4PLU/s1600/saint%2Blorena%2Bcover.jpg //2.bp.blogspot.com/-kTsHh7H5aPw/VeklDDNcZuI/AAAAAAAANEo/gj5g6B9cBwI/s1600/saint%2Blorena%2Bimg.jpg"

We didn't play with them (would have loved to, of courser), but the shirts were everywhere and bootleg CDrs seemed to be in every distro. I snagged a couple and jammed them when we got home and.....there was just an urgency hiding in the simplicity of their songs that I couldn't seem to wrap my head around. While I still can't put a finger on why they are so good, this copy of 2000's About War And Violence serves as an excellent reminder (to me) that STELLITE do the fukkn thing right, and sometimes that's worth way more than a bunch of words trying to describe why and how. Sometimes.....it just is. A little out of tune sometimes, a little loose most of the time, a little rudimentary in general and absolute fucking fire from start to finish.

A small touch of the '00s Danish nostalgia for '80s California, but with plenty of Southern European fire. \"Bajo Control\" is the banger, a mid paced number that begs for action surrounded by up tempo action with raw garage rock recording quality.

I got to see ARMY OF FLYING ROBOTS, and I think I saw Sned play drums (perhaps even at the same show), I got the CUDDLY TOYS \"Mad Man\" 45 about which I was pretty fukkn psyched. I got to play the 1 in 12 in Bradford, a smoke filled reggae bar in London, a high school prom in Margate, and at least one dude from AMEBIX was at our show in Brighton. I snagged some cool records to be sure (first POLICE single for 5 quid? don't mind if I do) and hung out with some killer folks, it was a really good time and our shows were damned solid. But there's one show I can't really remember...I think it was in Leeds, it was upstairs in some bar, and there was a band with a M\u00d6TORHEAD ripoff logo shirt that played (they were pretty ace) and there was another band who were rather popular at the time and I remember that they were really fukkn good even though I can't remember who they were (maybe THE HORROR? Yeah, I think that was them). Pathetic...my memory, that is. What I can recollect is that one of the dudes in that band was also in SEX MANIACS and he gave me this tape of their then new recording....and it rips. Look at what he wrote: Punk Rock 'n Roll influenced by BLACK FLAG, TURBONEGRO, AC/DC, OUT COLD, POISON IDEA. Seriously, that just about nails it, and SEX MANIACS totally own this sound. A decade later you can spend your Sunday getting rowdy as fukk all, and if you make it back to Leeds before I do, which is likely, then tell these dudes I owe them all beers. Or pints.

Imagine a aural exquisite corpse with each improvisational element building on and/or complimenting another sequentially, and then imagine dropping everything on top of everything else and running them on concurrently. Pieces influenced and impacted by one another, but often presented without context, without order, without direction...presented as chaos. The first track on 2007's Shamblers is particularly numbing, and perhaps the goal was simply to dull the listeners senses and disorient the mind, a palate cleanser to prepare you for a deliberate journey. That journey is thirty-plus minutes of free jazz improvisation, vaguely Kraut influenced monotony and a casual collection of intentionally non-constructed sounds. Horns (which particularly shine on the minimalist mesmerizing third tack), electronics and found sounds all contribute to a trip created and led by a collaboration of Michigan stalwarts.

Repetitive drum and bass lay the foundation and the guitar just freaks the fuck out for essentially the entire set. Like a contemporary Roland S.

But after the seal was broken...shit was over. I spent a fair bit of 2022 devouring the MegaKut catalog and uncovering innumerable links and connections...there's no rational reason that I should give half a shit about the DOUBLE LIFE Revolutions 12\" from 1997, but this is what happened and I'm more than OK with it. CREEP PLAYER is Sick with DJ RAW B (of the aforementioned DOUBLE LIFE),\u00a0Rival Dealer is as undeniably Bay Area as it is undefinably Bay Area - even a novice (and a transplant) like me recognizes the sound and the swagger though I would never try to own or describe either. As this year wraps, I feel like the sounds of CREEP PLAYER are like an invitation to a transition; a visitor from another plane offering you dark passage to a future destination.\u00a0RIVAL DEALER https://ironlungrecords.bandcamp.com/album/the-result-lungs-199 https://megakutrecords.bandcamp.com/music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oUx4mHe7_s https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiK5Zl6qQwXH6edMNvE2-3KyAYlU5BmwtlGd41A8hNID4vvBlNxNxZdt1c_e7CKO8XZQg0XPglX4j_WYXWULFyQIL6M8q8o1XhfE-gfvwBQlzrB9pxvmCKuF-_ghmBELXIEG9H_0I9qeIyXQ-WEyqLv72UX_x5uQhNmnTL0x72RfR6_3UBLbtBG8v22Rg/s1317/Creep%20inside.jpg"

The closer falls in line with the opener, \"Anchorites Of The Night\" is slightly more upbeat (but still dreary as all hell) while \"Hell Fuck\" embarks on a goth tinged industrial punk journey the likes of which you have never heard.

These re not the sounds I turn to, but I'll be damned if they aren't so good at the thing - this is what I wanted in high school, even though it didn't exist yet. Guitars are appropriately fuzzed out and sound massive, vocals swoon in a way that you are only supposed to hear on the radio, and it's like they take everything that is so easy to make fun of and make it good.

There's a line that separates \"primitive and raw\" punk from \"inept punk,\" and for the first few years of their existence, Finland's VIVISEKTIO blurred that line until it was as irrelevant as the tuning pegs on their guitars. Compiled from six rehearsals and two demo recordings, this collection of tracks features the same songs over and over (and over), but if you can stick it out through the first twenty (or so) songs you're treated to a couple of real nasty mid paced punk stomps that were apparently recorded in junior high school music class (maybe I'm wring here, but I'm going to roll with it). There's a second incarnation of the band that started in the 2010s, but this shit?

There are exceptions of course (like when I taped the STRESS record so I could share it here without breaking my self imposed guidelines), and Holland's SHIKARI is a perfect example. A collection of vinyl releases (splits with PHOENIX BODIES, SEEIN' RED, A\u00c7\u00c3O DIRETA and the\u00a0Robot Wars 10\") and is a perfect example of metallic European chaos frequently tagged with the screamo label. Maybe the label is fair if you want to be literal, as the music is certainly emotional and there is definitely a lot of screaming, but to put a band like this in a box with a label is to do them a severe injustice. The killer metal/hardcore/emo sound from late '90s Germany (SYSTRAL, AKEPHAL) is surely present, but the vocals are high, constant and beyond intense while the drums are a never ending barrage - I cannot think of another way to set the foundation for the wall of guitars that front SHIKARI. Mournful progressions, desperate and all encompassing, drawing inspiration from equally black metal and '90s emo. The level of intensity this band reaches with their very first burst of energy is one that most hardcore bands never achieve in their entire careers. So yeah, I am glad Malaysia's Bullwhip put this shit on a tape so I can share it here....and you are glad too. Powerful and essential.

Not surprisingly, this tape is made up of bands from Philippines and Malaysia, places where dishing out raw hardcore punk was way fukkn different than it was for me in the late '90s. There's something special about punk made in a time and/or place where just being a punk is/was a political statement, and I think that No Racism, No Authority! captures that brilliantly. BAD OMEN (blown out but still kinda melodic punk), N.S.A. (excellent 7 SECONDS styled posi-HC) and A.D.A. (ripping gruff ramshackle raw punk) from Philippines on one side with SILENT MAJORITY (accidental '80s Italian worship, easily the coolest songs on the tape), KHESOM (raw, sinister and borderline inept - this is high praise coming from me actually maybe these are the best songs on the tape), and F.S.F. (fast irreverent hardcore with killer vox and perfect guitar leads - So Cal fans rejoice, especially on \"Tolerate No More,\" an undiscovered classic jam) from Malaysia on the flip. Tapes like this frustrate me, because I want everyone to listen - but I can only say \"you need this\" so many times before the words become meaningless (and I'm afraid that happened sometime in mid-2005). But there's something different about punk that means something - and whether geographically, ideologically or musically, this comp nails it.

Most weekends were spent with John and Matt snorting speed, listening to that MENSCLUB disc on Bar/None (Side Note, punks:\u00a0this one is pure fire and motherfukkr creamed the drums like few fools I've ever witnessed), and talking about our band - I didn't really know anyone else, and this is a hard place to meet people. Eventually we started to fall in with a solid crew with whom we shared familiar common denominators like music and drugs...and that's where we met a dude named Steve. My memory says Steve played in TINA, AGE 13 (for the purists and historical perfectionists: the internet says this is not so), but perhaps Steve played in CORDUROY (?),\u00a0and Steve definitely lived at 109 Cypress (I mean...probably? I might be wrong here. He definitely did drugs there). 109 was a weird and dark place where I spent many mid mornings out of my fukkn mind...it was also a place inhabited and frequented by a bunch of fukkn geniuses. Steve played drums for FUCKFACE when we played a set of HICKEY covers for Tania's birthday party (that was the night HICKEY played a set of SABBATH covers as surf instrumentals - a legendary night in my brain) and was an all around solid dude who was always...all around. I honestly do not know how I came by this tape, and I didn't know that these sounds even existed until recently, but I can't say that I'm surprised. Equal parts '90s Mission, VASELINES and DINOSAUR, this collection of recordings is an actual portal into genius unrealized (or underutilized?).

Midwest sounds from 1990 that seem torn between reaching backwards to the DC sounds of the late '80s and breaking ground for the grunge explosion that was right around the corner. Without having any context for the band, I feel like they were perhaps (contextually?)\u00a0not unlike SLUGFUZLE, though probably more rooted in a DIY scene. Only four songs on this tape, and it's not hard at all to imagine a world where this band became something more than just a tape that a bearded sloppy internet hack could celebrate twenty years later (admittedly the vocals are pretty rough and warbly - although they are almost really good).

I'm not fucking encyclopedia, but I know a few things and it makes me especially eager to devour things I've never heard of - especially punk things, and especially punk things from Wisconsin and Oklahoma (though Ross has the Oklahoma market covered, so you should send your artifacts directly to him). So I reached out, and my pal Dug offered to send me his copy of Headless And Gutted to party with for a bit, and here I am...partying. You aren't in store for raging hardcore, but if you want a blast of irreverent screaming Midwest hardcore punk from the late 1987 then sign the fuck up. Listen #1 was excitement, anticipation. Listens #2 through #6 I was more like, \"Man, this shit is childish.\" And it is childish...but then, you put yourself in a VFW Hall in Cudahay as a surplus store army boot wearing 16 year old....and it's kinda like the greatest thing ever.\u00a0HEADLESS AND GUTTED=== https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCgTcN7hN-DOiXm-VLzN2Aw"

The sound owes as much to SXE 'crew revival subgenres as to the heavy aggression that Memphis (and Nashville) became known for in the early '00s, though the drawn out ending of the opener \"Funeral\" gives more than a casual nod in the latter direction. As I've said countless times in these pages, there are scores of bands like DEAD CITY - bands whose impact was rarely felt much outside of their respective epicenters, but who deserve far more than a casual mention in the footnotes of region specific DIY hardcore punk.

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on June 26, 2011 Description from Terminal Escape: FUCKFACE crossed paths with WHITE TRASH SUPERMAN twice on our 1995 US tour. First in Biloxi, Mississippi, where we played with five touring bands and a couple of local ska acts in a rented hall, and then in New Orleans on afternoon that followed the most exceptional (frightening) displays of alcohol consumption I have ever seen (participated in) and our drummer was still talking to his dead friends (out loud) while we were playing. The following year, we got towed to a show they arranged for us sometime near Christmas (I can't recall if it was in Starkville or Columbus, and I don't remember if WTS or Jayson's next band THE GRUMPIES played...I just know it was real close to Jesus's birthday, and kids got crazy - perhaps because they were\u00a0crazy). WHITE TRASH SUPERMAN are from Starkville, Mississippi, and their songs will seep under your skin and melt your icy jaded veins...this tape and their other demo were on heavy rotation in the van for many tours to come, and we were happy to spread the word to friends back home. Their sound is dredged through '90s poppy punk, but their delivery is all adrenaline and alcohol, placing them somewhere between HICKEY and SUPERCHUNK on my \"awesome melodic bands from the '90s\" meter. These tracks became WHITE TRASH SUPERMAN's only two EP's, Punk Rock Hero and Couldn't (If I Tried) b/w Wheaties, both released in 1995 or so. \"Couldn't (If I Tried)\" is as close to a perfect song as I've ever heard, and the words still get stuck in my head on a regular basis. The other two songs on this tape, \"Can Man\" and \"Staring At Your Walls,\" never made it to wax, but they are both brilliant in the same innocently mature manner as \"Couldn't (If I Tried),\" and shows a band years more advanced than their actual years. In a different world, WHITE TRASH SUPERMAN would have (should have) been playing to hundreds of college punk fans for the last half of the decade, but in our world, they recorded brilliant songs themselves on a 4-track, released the songs themselves on cassette and EP (using the imprint Did It Ourselves Records), and filled a handful of lives with memories. That's a pretty nice legacy.

Punks and punk adjacent metalheads started chattering about these bands from Scandinavia, of course there were the churches and shit that gave the whole thing an element of 'hmmmm, this is interesting' even beyond the music. On tour in 1995, FUCKFACE came across an interview with BLACK FUNERAL and we clowned that dude relentlessly in the van (later found out he worked at a Pizza Hut in Indiana and lived with his mom) before we used a quote from the interview as the center label for the Don't Hate Us 'Cause We're... EP and still...black metal was just curiosity. Meanwhile, black metal was consuming the scene in San Francisco - Lucifer's Hammer started hosting shows on Tuesdays and were responsible for MAYHEM, MORTIIS, EMPEROR, IMPALED NAZARENE and countless others playing a dive bar on Folsom street...on a Tuesday. And while this was happening....people were starting bands, and these bands made it very fucking clear to casual consumers that this new 'thing' was much more than a curiosity; this shit was for real. There was UNHOLY CADAVER - a recording project that came out of THUNDERCHIMP and evolved into HAMMERS OF MISFORTUNE. There was LUDICRA, who featured the guitarist from HAMMERS OF MISFORTUNE, the guitarist from MISSILE COMMAND, and the drummer from HICKEY along with Jessika from a drunk band called KETAMINE.And then....there was WEAKLING...WEAKLING were different, and 1999's Dead As Dreams is as much a genre defining record as anything I can conjure. The drummer from SANGRE AMADO, the guitarist from FUCKING CHAMPS and the dude from VOMITORIUM made something that changed everything.\u00a0 And then in 2023 this dude I know wanted to sell a bunch of tapes and I offered to help him more the units.....couldn't put a price tag on the WEAKLING tape so after some friendly discussions it lives with me now. This shit is so important (to me) that I don't give two shits how important the band was (is) in general - no one in North America did this better. Period. And this is seventy five minutes of proof.These tapes were dubbed off sporadically - I never saw this for sale anywhere....you got a copy of this if you were there, you dig? So I am honored to give this copy a (new) home.

The only respite on their self titled demo comes during the last track \"Blodets Hav\" - but it's a respite in the form of a midpaced squirmy one bass riff mosh part that draws out the inevitable with huge open guitar chords until it just fucking blows up.

They have clearly spent some serious time studying the guitar tones of the '80s greats, and have managed to combine classic Midwest hardcore and UK anarcho punk into one magical tone that shines through even on this rough demo recording. The SICKOIDS' sound lands nearby - with elements of legendary US hardcore colliding with modern melody and an approach clearly rooted in UK punk (PENI is heavily represented in most aspects of this recording, even the US hardcore bits). The players here are top notch (members of WITCH HUNT, DIRECT CONTROL, GOVERNMENT WARNING and CRACKS, among others), but previous bands be damned when I heard this shit, and this demo just serves to make me excited for future vinyl releases.\u00a0 SICKOIDS I did a little maintenance today, fixing some posts from the early days of The Escape. I was recently with a friend who had downloaded the MALICE demo from this site, and I was struck by how shit it sounded...I've gotten (a little) better at this since I started, and that demo deserves proper treatment.

The fuzzed out guitar has me hooked before the riffs even sink in, a dirty maxed out single track attack that brings to mind Japanese classics like BLUES CREATION. They take their time developing structures (two tracks here span over 20 minutes), meandering along the way for solos and hallucinations to remind you that the journey is absolutely the most important part of the journey. More listens only bring more comparisons that span decades and continents, which leads me to believe that SPEEDWITCHES are perhaps without time and/or space....just floating on the rock with no destination other than rock 'n roll.\u00a0 You can certainly call this stoner rock if you are so inclined, and it's obvious that SPEEDWITCHES are well versed in the SABBATH, SLEEP, KYUSS school. But the psychedelic end of the heavy spectrum represented in these tracks is what really sets them apart. They aren't aping any of the shamelessly retro bell bottom doom bands, they sound like they are actually from another time and another place. See above comment: more listens.

That's me the first time I heard this INSURGENTS tape. It has all of the trappings of a band made up of the only four alterna-teens in their town in 1992 - a little grunge, a little metal, a little USDIY basement hardcore - and that combination often takes a band to exciting places. \"Lane Change\" has pretty blatant\u00a0Too Fast For Love\u00a0guitar undertones, \"So Sure\" hits like primitive speed metal in one part and ALICE IN CHAINS in the verse, and \"Down River\" hits like MOTHER LOVE BONE. So...why does it work? I'm not sure, and I'm not even sure that it does.

I'm guessing everything here is beyond calculated, but when the math adds up like this, I can't imagine anyone complaining (listen to the opening riff in \"Give Thanks\" and tell me I'm wrong).

I zinged the singer from 14 OR FIGHT super hard while he was trying to give an Iraqi invasion related political speech on a defective microphone (note: I am not actually very witty in real life, but I totally won the exchange in question) and FUCKED UP were legitimately killer, even though I went to the show prepared to dismiss them as an overpriced two song single flavor of the month. The last time I saw PUNCH IN THE FACE was in 2007 - it was the last show ARTIMUS PYLE played (honestly, this was probably the single best show that band ever played), and BLOODY MINDED and DROP DEAD were on the bill also and the whole night was sick...but PUNCH IN THE FACE were unbelievably good (it was the record release for their only 12\", if memory serves). If you like aggressive hardcore punk and you missed PUNCH IN THE FACE, then: 1) you fukkd up, and 2) I'm here to help. Nine songs in ten minutes, and, title notwithstanding, \"Beer Cold, TV Loud, Homosexuals Flaming\" is seriously one of the bangingest bangers of all time, but \"The Start Of Your Ending\" might be even better.\u00a0 PUNCH IN THE FACE"

The subject matter is real, the compositions are advanced and FAGGOT just don't hit like. a regular band - or any band for that matter.

These sounds are mesmerizing...dark and extremely minimal, they take the ethereal ambiance of TANGERINE DREAM (channeled in \"At Midnight\"), combine it with primitive industrial (on \"Fear From Behind\"), and then use the amalgamation to fukk with your mind on \"Escape From Concrete Island.\" The beauty is in the simplicity, and these sounds are very very deliberate.

There's a tinge of goth that comes through on the tape that was perhaps absent live, maybe it was getting caught up in the moment or maybe it was ineptitude.

They predate the gruff approach to melodic hardcore from the FUCKED UP angle be several years, they were too late and too fast for JAWBREAKER comparisons, and somehow their catchy punk songs don't seem even remotely connected to the sounds of their contemporaries (then or now). \"If I Get Too Loud, Turn Me Down\" is undeniably infectious, and it kinda sets the stage for the rest of this early '00s four song cassette....a stage upon which yet another under-appreciated punk band will play hard and sweat their hearts out receive nothing even close to the recognition and/or accolades that their efforts warrant. And still they will keep playing, and that's why punk rules.\u00a0\u00a0 CANADIAN RIFLE"

So I try to pepper in the unknowns to spread the joy (or pain) and it seem to be working out pretty well so far. So I pulled out an unmarked tape from a box of live shits earlier this week - no writing on the tape or the j-card, just a TDK S-90 full of opportunity - and I pressed play on that fukkr. There was a hand written insert thankfully, and I quickly learned that I was in for 45 minutes of HEARTBEAKERS outtakes on one side which I can totally deal with....but it was the flip. It's always the mysteries lurking on the back side, right? A collection of stunner proto-punk and sleaze rock 45s was waiting for me there and I had not heard of a single one of them, so I cranked that shit. KILLER KANE BAND (featuring Kane from NY DOLLS and Blackie Lawless from W.A.S.P....in the same band) followed by a solo banger from JERRY NOLAN (from the DOLLS and HEARTBREAKERS) and HEROES (more ex-HEARTBREAKERS). A swanky ass slab from MICHAEL THIMR\u00c9N, famous for work with Nolan and Johnny Thunders but legendary (around TEHQ) for his time in BITCH BOYS leads into the 1984 single from Swedish rockers PILSNER (Jerry Nolan again).The sole 45 from BLESSED wrap the side...but the tape is pretty wrecked by then (probably been rocked too many times) so it'll take serious dedication to make it all the way through. Until you listen to \"American Bandstand\" and realize that you're hearing snarky punk perfection and you decide you don't give a fuck anymore. About anything. And this......? This is why we put our hands on things we don't know and hold on until we know.\u00a0LAMF 45s"

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on April 10, 2018 Description from Terminal Escape: Another installment in my likely futile quest to reinvent the lost decade of North American DIY punk. For the sake of most arguments in favor of the '90s sucking, the period in question actually spans something like 1988-1998, since by the end of the actual decade I think most people would agree that underground punk had stepped up its collective game in a very real (and very deadly) way. But despite questionable recording quality and an occasional lack of sonic direction (which is still, in my book, often a net positive), the '90s in Canada and the USA were fukkn teeming bands playing their asses off and touring like motherfukkrs - living was cheap and life was sometimes cheaper, and we just went for it. Nuclear war was no longer the boogeyman that dominated the '80s, and Reagan was gone as a whipping boy (GHW was a suitable replacement, of course), which freed bands up to explore subject matter beyond the obvious, often looking inwards in the process with admittedly questionable results. Scores of recordings that have spent years being looked over and dismissed for whatever reason (be it relevant, valid, or superficial) keep resurfacing...enter BUNCHA LOSERS. There's a DEAD MILKMEN vibe lurking, and contemporary East Bay punk surely played a role in this suburban band's development, but drop this tape into a different decade, take the toilet seat off the cover and tell a stranger that it's important, and all of a sudden off kilter (and off time) tracks like \"Couldn't Think\" become invaluable pieces of history. Context and perception can be as important as content, my friends.... DEEP AND MEANINGLESS"

I recognize that it's not a thing that I need, or even want, but if this is your thing then this track fucking nails it. After that song wraps...there are three more songs. \"Caterpillar\" continues on the same path, but with less of an edge and a more modern rock radio energy. Then comes \"'89\" and I'm starting to feel like I've been duped, just shitty blues/funk through a '90s alternative filter and \"Outside The Market\" which comes off like a lost GIN BLOSSOMS track.

Karoline was HICKEY's roadie and my (then extremely new) lady friend, but she was also very well known and well loved in RVA as both a frequent visitor and merchandise boss for AVAIL, so she sorted out the show. We were booked in a tiny basement with ALABAMA THUNDER PUSSY, the new project featuring AVAIL drummer Erik on guitar (and, for one show only, Adrienne from SPITBOY on vocals), but more than excited for the show, I was nervous about meeting my new lady's extended touring family. A steady but discreet stream of people checking me out, wondering if I was suitable...the way that scene looked over her and out for her is something that will always stick with me. One gentleman walked up to the entrance where I was standing next to Karoline and asked if I was Robert. \"Yeah,\" I replied. \"You'd better be good to her,\" he said, then he lifted his shirt to show the pistol in his waistband, dropped $20 in the donation jar, and left. You know, just regular punk stuff.\u00a0 ALABAMA THUNDER PUSSY (they lost the space between \"thunder\" and \"pussy\" at some point) would release several records on Man's Ruin and Relapse and tour relentlessly through the mid '00s. The KYUSS tinged swamp sludge from this demo gradually and organically gave way to hard rock influences (see 2007's \"Words Of The Dying Man\" video here, and check the LIFES HALT shirt and GWAR cameo).\u00a0 ALABAMA THUNDER PUSSY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4M1-Y-DO3k"

Quintessential East Bay punk, which is to say that ABANDON sounds like fukkn ABANDON - perhaps a sum of parts (parts that include but that are by no means limited to: FILTH, FIELDS OF SHIT, HUE & CRY, DYSTOPIA), or perhaps the product of simply writing songs without rules. Jake and Clara's vocals feed off each other perfectly, and Mauz and Jerry are so in the pocket at all times that it just makes sense when they start sneaking free jams into the tracks (I'm talking \"Edgar Bastard\" and \"Sometimes The World Is Clean\" specifically). These tracks (minus the PENI cover) found their way onto the Letters From The Landfill comp with THIS IS MY FIST, SHOTWELL and PEELS (aka OVENS) which you can probably track down easier than this tape...though the demo has cooler art.

I kinda miss the fastcore explosion of the early '00s - the energy was positive, and so many of the bands were as serious about the bigger picture as they were about thrashing hard, wilding out in the pit or looking the part (don't get me wrong, thrashing, wilding and wearing the uniform were very important aspects of the aforementioned explosion). When NO REFLEXION LEFT screams \"No Rules // I Am Free!!\" it sounds like they are celebrating something bigger than mindless blast beats or the discovery of an obscure band their friends haven't heard of...this shit really is about punk and hardcore and fastcore and thrash and friends without borders and without boundaries. NxRxL crank out seven of their own tunes and the 7 SECONDS cover that is ubiquitous to this scene as \"Sonic Reducer\" is to boring bar punk, but the energy is through the roof, the backing vocals are on point and every moment of this demo makes me stoked - even a decade later.

Vocals are spewed with an intensity that suits the musical assault - even when these kids \"slow down\" for a mosh part, their game is beyond fierce and there is not even a hint of party in this thrash. Not to say that BANDANOS take themselves too seriously, but simply that their attack doesn't leave any room for shenanigans. No frills, and no filler, this 2005 cassette just rips.

The first song has early-TORCHE caliber hooks hidden inside a song that is just so unbelievably devastating, a song that spends three-and-a-half of its six minutes struggling through piercing feedback and errant drum bombast, just tempting the listener to think they know what might be about to happen, or when. MANGLE are ugly, and it's their seeming determination to be ugly that makes them stand out (to me).

His band split up in 1986 and he said they all pretty much felt that punk in general was finished - not that they were finished with punk, but that punk itself was just....done. A few of them dabbled in other bands for a while (some embarrassing funk rock experiments that I'll keep in their collective closets). In retrospect, this seems wild to me, especially considering the flood of punk and hardcore exploding on the British Isles in the mid-1980s, but I wasn't there and I didn't have his experience so there's no judgement. Maybe this MARTIAL LAW demo would have made a bigger splash had been recorded a few years earlier, maybe the anarcho sounds (and...politics?) were just pass\u00e9 by 1985, or maybe that old head I was chatting with had temporarily reached maximum punk capacity after a few years of constant gigs. Regardless, Angry Songs clearly demonstrates what we already know: punk did not die in the '80s.\u00a0ANGRY SONGS"

So, yeah....I mean, we all have regrets. Anyway, this day is traditionally commemorated by overeating and watching sports, most notably a sport called \"football,\" which is somehow different from the most popular organized sport in the world, which is also called football. But it's good to have alternate plans, and today I suggest three North American punk rock acts, all contributors to the \"Do It Yourself\" subculture through varying eras and decades and scenes, all worthy of attention, and all stupid enough to release one song demonstration cassettes. Think about it, if an entire civilization can make an honest mistake in the interest of helping others, why should underground punk bands be held to a higher standard? FUCKBOYZ - \"Errol Flynn Was A Motherfucker\" Technically not a demo tape, this was likely the master for FUCKBOYZ' contribution to the Napoleon compilation EP, which featured A MINOR FOREST, DRIPPY DRAWERS, ALL YOU CAN EAT, NOT SO HAPPY, POSITIVE GREEN, 40% SALINE SOLUTION, and BABY CARROT. The Bay Area was a pretty sweet place for a while.\u00a0 SUNSET BEACH - untitled I don't know shit about this tape, but who the fuck releases a one song tape that lasts 71 seconds? SUNSET BEACH does (or did), apparently. This screams late '90s/early '00s melodic dirt punk, file alongside STRAY BULLETS or a thousand other bands who manage/d to combine earnest hooks with genuine aggression. Someone want's to tell me more, then I'm all ears. EYE JAMMY - \"Nuklear Beach\" Cheating just a little bit here, but if these hillbillies want to give me a fuckkd up two song cassette with only one damn song on it, then I'm gonna call the fukkn thing a one song demo. Fair? Fair. EYE JAMMY was one of the coolest bands I saw at this year's Everything Is Not OK festival, and the crew that they rolled in with certainly didn't hurt their casual claims of baller status (note to touring bands: always roll with a dozen rockers who know all all of your songs and can sing all of the choruses and dance their asses off - locals will think you are bad ass, and you will therefore feel and play like bad asses, it's a glorious cycle). I guess there's another song meant to be on this tape, but with a track as siq as \"Nuklear Beach\" I kinda don't even fukkn care...and also they are from Mississippi.\u00a0 FUCKBOYZ // SUNSET BEACH // EYE JAMMY Thanks.....you are welcome.\u00a0 https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8LDqCj8GvEo/WhTxq_McswI/AAAAAAAASC4/5zSdt88_mOsaSGOqXnwgqX671m1r5duTwCLcBGAs/s1600/FBoyz%2BErrol%2Bimg%2Bcopy.jpg https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lLAfgynBqLs/WhTyj0Ru9-I/AAAAAAAASDA/i4jAe9-Vg8U54cz3gEuzJ1XBbryNzfB-ACLcBGAs/s1600/Sunset%2BBeach%2Bimg%2Bcopy.jpg"

I think it's more of a gift for your friends, 'cause no one else is gonna hear that shit). It's funny to think of OUT OF TOUCH as kids, but in a Japanese scene dominated by DEMOLITION, RUSTLER, ZONE, NIGHTMARE and DEATHSIDE, OUT OF TOUCH were certainly the newcomers. 18 years after this demo was recorded, the singer served me a delicious vegan picnic in the rain not far from the Nagoya train station...Hidehito is a very nice man.

LUASA RAELON (one of three solo projects from Columbus, Ohio's David Nathan Reed) is a dark ambient adventure, using mostly synthesizers to take you on your journey. \"Iriri\"\u00a0appears in five movements, each delving deeper into a cinematic world for which the script has not yet been written. The term 'death' is often used when describing these kinds of dark industrial sounds, but rarely has that descriptor been used as appropriately as it is in reference to LUASA RAELON. Michigan's POST-MORTEM JUNKIE (another solo act, this time from the brain of Ryan Oppermann), raises the harshness level several degrees, trading fear inducing ambiance for creeping sinister electronic noise. By no means is \"Tremble\" a harsh noise assault, it is a subdued and deliberate build up of sound, culminating in a polite cacophony. POST-MORTEM JUNKIE's track is twisted and psychotic, it makes its point slowly. This tape is limited to 100 copies, and is available from Milwaukee's Expectorant. After you enjoy the sounds it contains, I suggest that you procure your own copy. \"Iriri\"/\"Tremble\" //4.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/TGHV7zGJI9I/AAAAAAAABKw/3wY0zzrm3O0/s1600/luasa+raelon+-+post+mortem+cover.jpg http://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2010/07/custodian.html http://www.myspace.com/davidnathanreed http://www.thinning-agent.com/ //1.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/TGHbp8A2JEI/AAAAAAAABK4/4e6ajwFKSjg/s1600/luasa+raelon+-+post+mortem+inside.jpg"

Five different tapes that made it into my life with little or no identifying marks. And to all the nerds (which is hopefully most of you), you see the challenge before you, the only question is whether or not you are up to it. So....are you? 1. Twelve tracks of chaotic industrial noise. Greatness is approached, embraced, and then cast aside over the course of one half hour. Cassette marked only as \"ETC.......\" HERE 2. Ten minutes of crucial grind/powerviolence. The completely unmarked tape was in a box full of master tapes and live recordings from '90s Bay Area bands, so I'm inclined to think this is from the same time/scene...but I cannot identify it. The recording is absolutely ruthless. HERE 3. I feel like I may have shared this one before, and simply unearthed a double? Dual vocal fastcore/thrash that I think is from South America. The recording varies quite a bit from track to track, but the vocals are pretty consistent so I think this is all the same band...but I might be incorrect. HERE 4. From the flipside of the DEAD FISH tape I posted a while back. The collection of Brasilian demos I picked up from Allan had many tapes with records dubbed onto the blank B side (like the WIDE AWAKE demo on the back of the DIASPORA tape). Someone with a better mental encyclopedia than me can surely pick this one out. HERE 5. Live (at least mostly?) outsider shit-fi punk. Four tracks, all essentially inept, possibly from England, and endearing (if only for a few minutes). HERE Get to work, kids...."

Cavernous experimentation meets deliberate bombast throughout five tracks spanning a full half hour, with spacious vocals that act more as an instrument of noise than a messenger. To be clear, the cuts are raw...and that only adds to the impact. The return of SIBERIAN ASS TORTURE on the flip is in some ways more of the same, but kicked up a notch in all departments. Those vocals are replaced by a guitar that just wails filthy leads and the tempo overall shifts up to a steady slog. Think about the most primitive PHARAOH OVERLORD sounds with a few stoner riffs...recorded in the barn next door.

Damaged and derivative downtuned PDX crust with guitars that sound like they were recorded onto magnetic tape scored out of the 7-11 dumpster while the drummer was shoplifting some .40s so the band could all get shithoused before they hit the 4-track. Dive bombs drop in from nowhere, guttural low end vocals are punctuated by high aaaaaaaahhhhh screams that hit like DISCLONE on Dilaudid. PUNGENCE are a raw crust pisstake, a band intentionally punching way below their weight in the most gloriously neaderthal-ic manner - you either have to try really hard to sound like this, or you sound like this because you don't know anything else.

They were good - like really good. Still kinda confuses me that people don't shit themselves over this outfit - crushing hc/crust with blistering metal drums and a whirlwind guitar that goes from borderline mince-meets-metalcore on the early recordings to screaming melodic Japanese influenced mania on the last few releases. HOMO CONSUMENS rip through\u00a020+ tracks of rapid fire gruff Czeck punk teetering on the edge of falling apart at almost all times. I actually prefer HOIMO CONSUMENS on this tape, but it might be because I like the later releases from SYIH (see below). SEE YOU IN HELL // HOMO CONSUMENS From 2002 to 2012, the Jed LP is the realization of more than a decade together - and you'd best realize that this band is a bulldozer. Drums are a constant double bass frenzy and the riffs hurt your brain if you think about them too much...these are advanced sounds that require maximum focus \u00a0because they deliver maximum destruction.

Like drinking a beer or eating a taco or ripping a new (or new/old) cassette for consumption. However, there are hundreds of worthwhile nuggets languishing in those dusty old internet pages, so I'm going to start re-posting from time to time...if nothing else I'm curious how I hear CHRISTIE (using today's example) in 2017 vs. whatever nonsense I wrote about them in 2010. And I'm sure the curiosity is absolutely killing you, dear reader.... So here are six tracks from 1988, sweet lilting vocals floating over an almost cacophonous collection of driving late anarcho and metallic guitar leads. As I mentioned in the original post, I have two different recordings of these six tracks (both included today), and I opted for the dirtier version initially. I think that I've come to enjoy the (slightly) more polished recording over time...though the differences are subtle at best. Just because you miss the magic once, doesn't mean it's gone forever.

I was instantly pleased, because I feel like this is the band that JFF (former bandmate in High On Crime, ex-Kung Fu Rick) has wanted to play in for years...and it's really good. Absolutely disgusting and sinister doom from Chicago, DISROTTED set the stage with their opening riff, a riff that switches to single note speed picking (well, the painful sludge version of \"speed\") at the 1:51 mark to accompany blood curdling screams to let you know what you are really in for. Raw and chaotic throughout - a rehearsal recording doing constant battle with absolute sonic devastation, and I'm not quite sure who wins. Except you. You win by listening to this morose three song lump of negativity. Winning is a mixed bag, my friends...you're welcome.

The approach to sludge-laden slogs was punk, which brought justifiable BUZZOV\u2022EN comparisons, but the approach to punk was fierce and femme in the face of those comparisons. They recorded an album with Billy Anderson while they were out here, an album that has (unfortunately) never seen the light of day, and the band spread out shortly afterwards. The bassist spent has been in several bands since, and is currently in a freak punk outfit called GRP.TXT.

Old school USHC riffing with the BPMs ramped up to just a hair shy of utterly ridiculous, this Swedish two piece blazes through 31 songs in under 11 minutes...and that's not a typographical error. There are hooks galore, just precious little time for you to grab them \u00a0-\"Errare Humanium Est\" is the longest song on this collection, clocking in at a whopping 0:37, and the mid tempo breather it provides (the only one on the tape) is as welcome as its simple brilliance. A far cry from ten second blasts of nonsensical grind or noise, this is full speed hardcore stripped of everything but the most essential parts...think about listening to an abridged version of the TOTAL FURY 13 Songs 12\" or the first DS-13 EP on 78rpm. It's almost a shame to hear so many great riffs and manic changes \"wasted\" on such a criminally short release (which is actually a collection of a 12\" and two EPs and the thing is still just over ten minutes) - but it just means that you listen to it again as soon as your done to pick up the parts that you missed.

But far too often, the sounds are just rehashed or recreated, and the instant availability of every subgenre's historical digression has made the problem even worse. Whatever your interest, you can learn from the masters and vomit out exactly the same thing...if you're good enough. And sometimes that's enough - without naming names, there are stacks of records on my shelves from bands that are relatively unimaginative but who are really fukkn screaming. I'm fine with that (I think we punks all are to an extent, or we would've gone the free jazz route years ago), but I really like it when a band kicks the paradigm in the gut while still somehow fitting within it. Enter SLAVESTATE 641A. These two songs nurse at the teat of SWANS, JESUS LIZARD, even KILLDOZER (tonally, if not conceptually), but an entirely new animal is born out of an insemination of influences.

About your life. About the choices you've made and the path you've chosen. Tonight was one of those nights - a few relatively brief interactions that knocked me in my gut and woke me up. I hope that you have one of those night (and/or days) soon...and I hope that you actually and honestly evaluate where you are, even if what you see makes you uncomfortable. And I hope that you don't just look to the ones that came before you and forged your path, I hope that you look to the ones that followed and lived by ideals instead of examples...the ones who have made their own path. Punk has digressed far beyond a mere commodity, but the root is still valuable and more than worthy of nurturing - both for our own benefit and that of those who do not yet know that punk even exists.

I knew Neal only casually from reviewing records at neighboring computers, and I can't imagine that our respective bands appealed to one another in the slightest, but somehow we started talking about his new band OiL! and I was intrigued. Whether Neal magically knew that this was exactly what I needed in my life or just wanted to make some new fans I may never know, but he left an OiL! tape in my box and my life hasn't been the same since. I could rant for pointless paragraphs about how many times I've listened to this tape, about how immediately catchy every fukkn one of these songs is, about how \"Proud Of My Pride\" and \"Clockwork Violence, Leftwing Silence\" would become a part of my life for the next decade (and hopefully more), about how the guitar that starts \"Fuck You\" made me reconsider music. But instead I'll just say that I like this OiL! recording A LOT and I have listened to it hundreds of times - whether the people around me wanted to hear it or not. Brilliantly catchy, this teeters on the line between brilliant and dodgy from start to finish, but you'll find yourself chanting \"skinhead\" with an non-ironic fist in the air before this shit is over. Sealing the deal, my advance copy of this work of sheer brilliance came with hand fukkn written lyrics to every damned song - now you can sing along with songs like \"Red White & Boots,\" \"Shave For Battle\" and \"I've Got Bills To Pay\" and not feel even remotely guilty. Perfect punk, read the lyrics to \"Crucified Hammerskin\" if you still have any doubts. This has been officially released on vinyl and CD, but my copy is cooler than all of that shit - see the aforementioned lyric sheet if you don't believe me.

Even if you don't understand them. OCMC have turned basement punk into Haidakhan Babji chants and mantras, manipulating purpose and intent and defying description or categorization in the process.

Randy Rhoads is still wielding the axe in these sessions, his stint with Ozzy would start later that year, and this is the same lineup that dished out two glam LPs in Japan before crumbling and then being resurrected by DuBrow to become the first of the LA sleaze rock bands to land a major label deal. Rhoads is prominent on this recording, laying down screaming leads and more swagger than on his later (and far more famous) work. Several generations old, the tape shows some wear, especially on Rhoads' six plus minute live solo near the end, but you don't have to have a QUIET RIOT tattoo to get into the alcohol soaked party vibe...it does help though. 1979 DEMO + 1978 LIVE //1.bp.blogspot.com/-4_U1eURNdks/Tu7lEVIGvWI/AAAAAAAACLE/wDIYmntsZsk/s1600/quiet+riot++copy.jpg"

Haunting and cacophonous bursts of unrestrained frustration, punctuated by childishly enthusiastic drums that spend the entire demo putting the listener on edge - almost as much as the pained and frustrated personal-hardcore-by-way-of-poetry-slam vocals. Background drones will lull you, while senseless guitars swarm through the mix with an urgency that embodies the entire sound of this tape. I don't expect everyone to like Social Services, but for those that get it, this band is completely mesmerizing in the same way that early SONIC YOUTH, EINST\u00dcRZENDE NEUBATEN and PUSSY GALORE recordings transcend talent and exist on a purity of vision that sets them apart from their peers.

And two of my desert island 45s are by BUREAUCRATS and WHITE HEAT. Helsinki's PLASTIC TONES are a little more laid back than most of the aforementioned acts, but in a really fukkn cool \"summer night cruising really slow\" way that almost makes them even cooler.

You get a tape from the used section because it looks like it might be cool - it's a band from Belarus and a band from the Bay Area and it looks cool so it's worth a gamble....right? And then the Belarusian band starts with a song called \"Blue-Eyed Land's Horizon Will Flare With Fiery Crimson\" and I'm all like shit I got me some weird NSBM nonsense here? but I can't really tell. So do I chuck it? Or do I listen and acknowledge that these are sounds that have no relationship to or affect on my life in any actual sense, and perhaps I can listen to them with objective ears? I honestly don't know, because these things are important and intent trumps sound any fukkn day in my book....but I'm unclear here. GNEIU are outsider black metal, a chaotic onslaught of aural misanthropy - \u00a0the meandering shoegazing of \"Disobedient Spirit Of Wind\" followed by the nonstop whirr \"Breathtaking Taste of Enemy Blood\" with no apparent direction other than total destruction. The shit is intense and introverted, but explosive and dangerous. LASCOWIEC are at least more understandable, if not digestible. Buried blasts of treble ridden agony, a call to harsh winters never known (c'mon man, these dudes are from the Bay Area), this is relentless, pained black metal in the most base and classic sense. It's also really weird sounding, so digest that info however you like. I don't know what either of these bands are like, what either of these bands believe, or what either of these bands are into, but I know that \"Before The Birth Of Storm\" is a super heavy track....so there's that.

They were notable (on flyers, anyway) because the drummer was Spider from AMEBIX, but I admit that the main draw for us was that they were all awesome to hang out with. Just a few shows, including an insane weekend festival outside of Tenino, Washington that featured ATROCIOUS MADNESS and who fucking knows who else. There were a lot of drugs. There was a dude cruising around with a backpack stuffed with mushrooms and a criminally long blade with \"Hippie Killer\" engraved in the side (the irony was not lost on us). We dubbed the fest \"Wasted In The Woods\" and by the end people were just randomly screaming \"WAAAAASSSTEEDDDD!!!\" to the gods and it definitely seemed like nothing good could come from staying any longer. We slept in tents (note: I didn't say we camped. Camping implies some kind of preparation) and it was cold as shit. I was sharing a tent with their guitarist Lee Provins (more recently a member of BLACK ROCK HIGH), who stumbled and/or crawled in one night several hours after I had turned in. He was fumbling around, trying to situate himself to pass out but mostly just making a mess and waking me up, he spilled a full beer in our 2 person tent and tried to clean it up with a roll of toilet paper (hint: that doesn't work). He mumbled something as he was trying to get the beer soaked toilet paper mush off his hands and clothes and I looked up, admittedly annoyed. Lee was on all fours, pants partially down, facing away from me with his ass next to my face. He looked sheepishly at me over his shoulder and with shocking lucidity said, \"Wanna have sex?\"MUSIC FOR GREEBOESLee made me this tape several years later. A sinister collection of thrash metal on one side (CRANIUM, POSSESSED, WARHHAMMER, SODOM) and snippets from John Peel's BBC Radio program on the flip. He put the Peel stuff together for me so I could hear my bands being played on the show (the kid in me still gets a wee bit giddy every time I hear his distinguished voice say \"from the ....Fucked From Birth LP\"), and then the end of that side is another mix - more all over the place and really nicely curated. Consider this a prized possession I suppose - or at least a really nice gesture and a ripping tape? Anyway, we never did have sex.\u00a0\u00a0 https://b7recordings.bandcamp.com/album/morality-carwash-2"

Drugged out synths dominate a recording that was perhaps initially meant by the artist to be akin to reggae/dub, but manifests something completely different. Like a SCIENTIST session invaded by Latvia's ZODIAC, Root jams through an hour of bizarre, innocent and pure sounds that transcend earth and universe, unrestrained by convention, tradition, or gravity.

HOPE FOLLOWED BY DESPAIR is noise. Just noise. No apparent structure, certainly no songs, and definitely no riffs. Just....noise. But to be able to take that and make it engaging requires skill (or luck, or the right mindset), and that is what happens here. True, there are are moments that are engaging on their own (start around the 4:23 mark of the first track and you'll see what I mean), but the vast majority of this tape is just...noise. It'll knock you off your rocker and reset your brain at the same time - which will help you endure the 45 minutes that follow because you will need a clean slate to digest this shit. Listen.

When you have time to kill and an empty room to use...things happen. Marek (INSUICIETY, M\u00d6NSTER, many more) was on tour with us, and that fool hits the drums real good, so we started a band with him on drums, me on bass and John and Dathan playing guitar. No vocals...we figured that we would just figure that part out at the last minute. The \"last minute\" turned into drafting a stranger who wandered in from the bar as we were using our soundcheck time to create our new band. Dude ran through it once and then it was showtime. Four songs, probably not more than eight riffs total, and I bet at least three of them are just open E. We named the band HELVETE-something-or-other, that I remembered translating to \"HELLTRAIN,\" but it was a long time ago and the beginning of the tape is tough to make out. Six minutes total, including in intermission that was apparently us just hanging out on the stage as if there was no one in the room. Interested labels get in touch. Formerly Known As: BEWARE OF THE DOGS John and I did the same thing with a different drummer/roadie at an ill-attended ARTIMUS PYLE gig in Cesena, Italy in 2003.

EYES OF CROW are so brutally simple that you feel like you've heard every song before, and it's that simplicity that makes this demo work. I was fukkn hungry for each track because I knew what was waiting for me, and then \"Katastrofe\" starts and the guitars are buried and it sounds so dark and ominous...like a door is closing. And then it's over. In less than ten minutes, my faith in ramshackle DBeat hardcore - a faith that has never wavered - has been strengthened by a seven year old cassette from Spain.

Actually, I think it was BUCK BUCK (also from Arkansas, and also criminally under appreciated), and maybe I never saw SHUT THE FUCK UP! play live....which is a shame. *Loading out from a show at the Covered Wagon in SF, this wasted dude came up to me and told me (definitely didn't ask me) that I should drive his band on tour because they were punk as fukk and they were going to put out a record and they had a contact in New Orleans and all they needed to do was book a few shows there and a few shows back and that was it and it was going to be really good and I should drive them. I told him I wasn't interested (because ..I mean, would you be?), but obliged him as he slurred about how great his band was. Eventually I asked what his band was called and he said \"SHUT THE FUCK UP\" and without even taking a breath I was like \"dude - change your fucking name, there's a band from Arkansas called SHUT THE FUCK UP! and they are very good. Save yourself the trouble and confusion and change your name before you put out that record. Trust me.\" Of course they didn't change their name and I imagine more people know about San Francisco's STFU today.\u00a0 *I think there is only this demo and one EP for you to dig into, but one listen to the quirky driving basement pv/noise/crust that is SHUT THE FUCK UP! and I think you will feel the same way I do, and you will be happy to have whatever you have. Because this shit is great.\u00a0 *Was Dave Dean in this band? Or am I confusing them with BUCK BUCK (again). Man...that Dave Dean dude is nice as shit, and has a wonderful way of making you feel like you totally matter, in a way that is difficult to describe.\u00a0 SHUT THE FUCK UP!"

Advanced North American hardcore punk from 1983, hints of 7 SECONDS/YOUTH BRIGADE melody and full speed ahead 'core that hurtles from one song to the next with a CLITBOYS-caliber fury.

Meticulous liner notes with background information where needed....everything is here. A '90s DIY/emo focused and Maryland focused tape that has THE HATED, SPASTIC RATS and (then unreleased tracks from) MOSS ICON sharing space with DON CHERRY, CAN and TALKING HEADS. Also making appearances: tracks from the elusive WFMU set from SLEEPING BODY, ODIE HAWKINS, FUNERAL ORATION, ROBERT FRIPP, RUIN and others. This is why we keep coming back. This is the magic shit.

Rooted in Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois folk but with an ear to Faubert's '80s act JANITORS ANIMATED (I snagged the My God He's Terrible 12\" from another discount bin on a trip to Tulsa in the late '80s...) this tape is full of beautiful haunting a cappella lilts with instrumental accompaniment on two notably excellent numbers. \"La Passion De J\u00e9sus-Christ Telle Qu'inspir\u00e9e Par L'\u00c9vangile Selon Majorique Duguay\" is a mouthful, but rarely do I come across a single track that so completely envelops the listener, and rolling straight into the light hearted \"Lamentations Sur Les Restes D'un \u00c2ne\" is a perfect segue. The sincerity in the voice makes it sound as if Faubert is manifesting as Leonard Cohen singing alone in a cathedral - something that I wouldn't have known I wanted to hear until I actually heard it.

Some of them were around, some of them didn't live in Milwaukee and only showed up every now and then, and most of them were several years younger than the remnants of the '90s scenes that we were already friends with. This is all to say that I knew them, but our inner circles didn't really intersect. That changed over the years, and I ended up doing shows with some of them, even played in a couple of (very brief) projects with people rooted in that world, and I consider several of them friends today. But, I still find myself surprised when I go back and listen to some of the bands, and I wonder why they were not absolutely kicking my ass 17 years ago. Maybe I was too concerned with a Swedish DBeat, or something about the haphazard spastic energy just didn't grab me for some stupid reason but, while it was obvious that these bands were good, I don't think I acknowledged that they were great. I'll rectify that now: TAB! are great. These kids took early Midwest hardcore by the horns and refused to drag it out of the basement. Songs about diet soda, energy from adolescence.

Seminal '80s thrash/death metal from Chicago, these hessians released various versions of a relatively small handful of burners on two demos and self released full length (cassette) during their short existence. Unclear exactly which session this tape is from, since Daniel got it from the band at some point, but you get screaming renditions of \"Cranial Hemorrhage\" and \"Beyond Fear\" along with five tracks I couldn't positively identify...but I can declare that the (brief) mosh riff in the third (instrumental) track is unfuckwithable. Fretboard gymnastics are next level on all tracks, but DEVASTATION never sacrifice speed or intensity in the process, these dudes are hard as nails and unrelenting throughout. Collections of the demos have been released on CD and there's a vinyl box that includes a couple of live sets for the completists. But start here...

Not like \"more than anyone else\" and who really cares because it's not a fukkn contest, I'm just saying that I have a lot of tapes and sometimes it's hard to keep track of the history associated with each one. Some of them instantly trigger memories or connections, some of them remind me of shows or people or reviews or places in time...and some of them just make me wonder where the fukk they came from. Maybe we played together, maybe I saw the band, maybe it was a thrift store gamble, maybe it was review fodder that I didn't even give half a shit about the first time I heard it because the stars weren't aligned just so....but now it kicks my ass. This is why they (tapes) are great, and why I hold onto (most of) them way longer than I should. This is also why I have no fukkn clue how EQUILIBRIUM came into my life and/or my collection. Either primitive or primal dirges from 2002, they drop demonic metal vocals on a brutality borne of determination and commitment, resulting in something that is not hardcore, not sludge (ok, maybe sludge), not punk, not metal...but definitely tortured and fukkd in every possible way. Those are the sounds we like around here, and so the collection grows.\u00a0 EQUILIBRIUM"

Rarely did anyone who was actually cool play at Nightbreak (don't get me wrong, heaps of cool bands played there, just not bands that were \"cool,\" if you get the difference...and ASSFORT and GAIA were obvious exceptions), so it was random and curious that this guy would come to our mutant shows occasionally and hand out a few tapes every now and then. The dude was chill...and if memory serves, very tall. I eventually saw DEFACE and it was exactly what I expected: old(er) bros (at the time that probably meant 30 or so) trying to adapt their meat and 'taters US hardcore into raging DBeat. I'm not saying it didn't work, I'm just saying that the end result was probably not what they intended. The honest simplicity is refreshing today - not trying to be more over the top, more chaotic or more insane, just bashing the shit out of some riffs and being pissed as hell, all things I can absolutely get behind. I'm pretty sure DEFACE only managed two EPs, each containing a couple of these tracks, DRI crashing headlong into DISCHARGE.

Hopefully I will keep discovering new (or \u201cnew to me\u201d) bands from that decade well into the 2030s, because I heard HEAVENLY for the first time in 2021 and it was pretty damn perfect. I wish there were a reality that felt as simple and careless and...pretty as this 1992 recording. But that's gone. So maybe that past is what we have. Shared here in the form that it came to me: no cover, no context, a faded and damaged label, just an imperfect vessel limping to my shores with its blissfully innocent cargo.\u00a0LE JARDIN DE HEAVENLY https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj6J6rvSpSFQhin2C198hJ3Ho3BXe3KH46MZEkdEvmlt_Y7Lf3qC6_y5SvR7CJZ-zMZGV_MldS68TgFkLuOgwHeXEfy4a-gqBWJaCgOu0HRuvSFRCySJlf49Vf3e2OAD2MwhI4viW9pBZHYu8oXx1Abgo6GKQSxlocPENcqJOcTJJmAL3PXkQSDcAbzyw=s810"

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on October 02, 2019 Description from Terminal Escape: Last night, Spencer and I were talking about music and specifically how much we sometimes missed the \"anything goes\" 1990s in the face of the \"flavor of the month\" new millennium reality. A reality where people can use a mouse like a vacuum and suck up entire subgenres without ever taking the time to digest, to interpret, to manipulate the very influences that shape their sonic existence. There are so many killer bands, to be sure, more than this grown ass man can possibly keep up with, but too often they fall into \"bands that sound like this\" or \"bands that sound like that\" instead of the broader, more inclusive \"this is punk, but....where is this coming from?!\" that demands your attention. So Spencer, here's FAMILY SECRETS. One demo in 2014 (this one, naturally), and that's all you get. Ten minutes of loose hardcore with distinctly '80s double snare taps (and some ridiculously fast rolls thrown into the middle of riffs where they rarely belong) and an unmistakable BG.K. vibe that lurks just below the surface. The guitar and bass are EQed to occupy the same same, and the result gets a little muddy at times, but in the way that Dusty Hill's bass gives early ZZ TOP live recordings the perfect amount of not quite perfect. And FAMILY SECRETS are full throttle throughout, like they are going hard because they have to and they don't seem to care who listens because they are making it their own and they are making it for themselves.\u00a0 FAMILY SECRETS"

And apparently they have captured the very essence of late '80s/early '90s alt/college rock in all of the best ways. The trappings that bands fall into when they try to phone in this shit....the clich\u00e9s those bands so easily fall into....those of us where were there can spot a fake a mile away, and it fukkn annoys me. But right out of the gate MONSTER TREASURE seems real, like WEDDING PRESENT and SEBADOH and MERCURY REV at the same time but through a time warp purifier thing that can somehow ensure that they aren't openly aping (or directly acknowledging) any of their influences, they are just embodying the thing...and it's amazing.

You also had punk and hardcore bands cranking out killer records. GOD cranked out three full lengths around the turn of the decade - way more on the rock and or grunge tip (sign of the times, you know?), but this 1987 recording leans heavier on NYHC and SUICIDAL influences. The transfer is admittedly not the best (tapes, motherfukkr!), but there are some nice rougher versions of some cuts that would appear on the Sweet Life LP, plus \"Survival Of The Meek\" is a total slammer and doesn't seem to pop up anywhere else.\u00a0GOD - 1987 DEMO"

Equal parts (early) DRI and SLAYER with a thankfully subtle element of cheese, these maniacs dished out a slab that holds up perfectly today - in fact it makes me want to wreck shit.

It was around 30 minutes long and featured essentially one riff (alternately: one essential riff) and a series of mostly improvisational movements. One would take the mic and the lead, then another would follow until they themselves were in control of the direction, transferring power and vision seamlessly from one member of the ensemble to another in the context of soul crushingly heavy doom colliding with soul crushingly heavy outside/r sounds. It didn't simply work, it was simply beautiful. And I don't want to elevate that night to a pedestal upon which it doesn't belong, but the following day when I ripped this 1966 JOHN COLTRANE recording the similarities were stark. Coltrane and Sanders feed off of each other throughout this hour long performance, sometimes both taking a backseat while Alice Coltrane contorts her piano, the recurring melody popping in and out sometimes seemingly at random and other times clearly very calculate. Rashied Ali seems intent to drive the group to the very edge of the cliff and hold them there with a steadfast looseness, keeping you on edge even while Alice's piano (note: this is particularly evident around the 32 minute mark) offers the most innocent beauty imaginable. It really is a thing of beauty, just like the show last weekend...so maybe the comparison holds more logic that I gave it credit for.\u00a0 MY FAVORITE THINGS"

A place where skill and desire clash with a fury that cannot be translated from the ears. A place where LOS PUNK ROCKERS still reign, no matter what is in fashion, because punk rules. OK? OK.

Sole member Rudolf, The Proud offers up seven doses of full throttle black/power metal as CATACOMB VOICES with incessant leads and a song construction/delivery that almost makes it seem like this year's debut release was created as one long piece - many songs have no end, just a quick fade, and some start the way with no real beginning. High end and anxious, the solos border on comical even though there's nothing whatsoever to suggest that there is a tongue in this cheek.\u00a0 There's a fine line between innocence and brilliance, and I think in this case the purity of vision helps to blur that line. Repetitive drum machine stomps and relentless hammer-on sweatpants riffing isn't exactly most people's idea of a good time, but it feels real here....it feels honest. Most of the evil conjured by Rudulf's prior entity SOVEREIGN has been supplanted by driving metal power, though the vocals still serve up a demonic edge and CATACOMB VOICES seem to be in a constant struggle for clarity, which is part of what makes it sound so real. Basically...I'm in.\u00a0 CATACOMB VOICES"

We hosted then in Oakland, and arranged summer travel plans to see them in Reno and Chico because...things were different and we were younger and that's just what you did then. So imagine my excitement in the new reality when I laid eyes on this tape while BAD WAITRESS was playing in LA last weekend....because I love the shit out of DS13 but I didn't have this tape. Well, now I do and my new reality self is giving a hearty nod to old (young) me for knowing what the fukk was up, because motherFUKKR this is (still) the shit that I need.

These pre-teens from G\u00f6teborg were an absolute force - hyper fast blow out hardcore, unhinged and full of the kind of energy that I've come to believe that adults simply cannot conjure. The drums are a textbook example of hardcore punk drumming, and that element of NISSES N\u00d6TTER is where I keep turning my ear, even while the rest of the band is raging beyond belief and the singer is wailing in pre-pubescent frustration. A full LP/CD re-issue came out a few years ago with live and rehearsal tracks, while this release is simply the Kn\u00e4ckta N\u00f6tter demo in all its fury.

But embedded in that mass of hastily thrown together throwbacks were (are) some brilliant releases and some bands who were using available tools to create their own sounds....no one sounds like UNREAL THOUGHT. Layers of spoken vocals, damaged and piercing guitars, a dark shroud drawn over a punk band who still sounds like a fucking punk band.

They take hooks and anthemic Oi! tinged punk and make it more aggressive and sinister than I can possible explain. A lot of that rage is from Ned's vocals, though the relentless pace has a lot to do with the tension and the guitar is unhinged, even when sneaking melodic leads in between choppy riffs steeped in chorus. This demo is passionate and real, and in an overwhelming sea of new bands and new trends and new next big things, THE BROOD is important.

Or perhaps just some context? Basically I just know that TRANSVESTITE are from Atlanta and THE CHAIN are from Olympia and that I like both of these tapes. So today you are lucky. Today you get to choose. Not that far removed from the stuff that we lazily refer to as \"emotional hardcore,\" TRANSVESTITE combine desperate female vocals with earnest and overly intense punk. Guitars affected in a weird Mould-by-way-of-Gravity manner (and if that means anything to you then you are likely intrigued) drive a band that clearly leaves everything out there. I like this tape a lot, and have jammed it dozens of times since it came into my life. I hope that you like it too. TRANSVESTITE ==================================================== You know those bands that almost play a kind of punk that you don't like but they are so good at it that you remember that you really dig punk songs and not just killer riffs? Those bands whose earnestness (and, more importantly, honesty) transcend genre and you find yourself not caring what scene they come from or what scene you align yourself with...you just want to see them play live? Enter: THE CHAIN.\u00a0This is just right, and once again the guitar is transfixing. Maybe someday I will see this band live, because while I cannot really imagine all of these sounds happening at once (emotionally and aurally) - I'm sure it does.

Thanks to the people who stop by from time to time, thanks to the people who comment, and thanks to the people who mention in person that they found something cool here. The 1,700 mark is just around the corner....that's a lot of fukkn tapes.\u00a0 ================================================= STEVE B. GRENADE I've been sitting on this one for years, waiting for whatever struck me as the right time. Well, Happy Birthday to me and here's the tape that gave this blog its name. Terminal Escape is lo-fi bedroom 4-track anarcho nonsense, but it strikes a chord somewhere deep inside. It was 1982, and obviously this dude had already figured out that he didn't need anything other than a tape recorder to make his magic, and I thank him for it thirty years later. TERMINAL ESCAPE =================================================== THE DECEASED Keeping on the nostalgia trip, here's the first tape I posted here on 09 June 2009. I re-ripped it and scanned the full cover, so even if you already have this bad boy lurking around somewhere, it's worth updating (I'm a little better at this shit than I was then). Of all of the random and un(der)known UK stuff I've shared here, this one is still one of my favorites. Only thing I'll change about the original write up is that \"Anarchy On Sat. Night\" doesn't really sound all that bad...I guess my standards were higher then? One of many bands that I can find virtually zero information about. The KFTH site (here) has no bio, and I can't say with any certainty even\u00a0which\u00a0of the four listed demos i am listening to. What I\u00a0can\u00a0say, is that these three tracks are fucking ruling, lo-fi UK punk. Sneering vocals, and drums pegged way into the red...it's endlessly amazing to me that bands made demos sound so fucking good with no money and no experience, punks have been trying to recreate the sound of the early 80s tapes for 25+ years, always always unsuccessfully. Apparently, the band changed the songs on the demo after they made the covers...but whatever the reason, there is only one song that is printed on the cover that made it onto my copy, and that track, \"Anarchy On Sat. Night\" is recorded so poorly that on this 25 year old cassette, it is not listenable. More demos to follow....

A spirit that floats effortlessly between borderless realms of improvisation, New Age, future jazz and almost scientific experimentation, Brown's creations present a sonic body that can be contained by none of those descriptors. As with most presentations of early (or earlier) experimental and/or ambient sounds, proper contextualization and academic discussion are not things I am qualified to provide or facilitate, but I can say that these two pieces from David Brown are gorgeous and haunting aural assemblages - the other worldly ambient jazz of \"Fever Dream\" gives way to an almost CRASS-like disorienting aural collage, while \"Sonic Vista\" is, as much as it is anything, exactly what the title suggests. And as always, there is so much more out there....you will never find it all. That's why it's so hard to stop.\u00a0MUSIC BY DAVID BROWN - 1984-85\u00a0"

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on March 22, 2019 Description from Terminal Escape: The title of this mix should really give you all that you need. Well known Japanese hitmakers GHOUL (Jerusalem EP - 1985), THE EXECUTE (Hardcore Temptation EP - 1983), THE CLAY (Middle East Combat Area EP - 1984) and POISON (Mystery Temptation EP - 1986) join forces with a slightly more under the radar banger from CASBAH (1987's Infinite Pain EP, which has appeared here before but deserves a revisit) and R.U.G.'s wild NWOJHM-esque\u00a0Deathly Fighter/Crazy Bomber 45. These are all mandatory releases, and most command serious coin (because they are mandatory)....so crank these degraded twenty year old mix tape quality reproductions and save your coffee shop tips. But the real highlight here is AZAGTHOTH's 1987 filthy deathrash masterpiece Shredded Flesh demo. The only non-Japanese act on the tape, AZAGTHOTH was a short lived Shane Embury side project and they were absolutely disgusting. To listen to \"Bloodsucking Freaks\" is to forever alter your perception of what is music. Three tracks here (P.D.C.,\" \"Dwell On Death,\" \"At Our Leisure\") that don't appear on most (any?) of the track listings I've found online, but the dude who made this for me was teenage penpals with the people involved, so who knows. Dig it: Mix Tapes > Youtube Algorithms.\u00a0 CASBAH, AZAGTHOTH and more.... https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2011/02/casbah.html"

I got my ass handed to me. Supposedly the combination of BIG ZIT and OOZE were really the kings of the region (and maybe no coincidentally, the most hardcore of the lot, including the bands that followed), but CONEHEADS, C.C.T.V., DAGGER, LIQUIDS....the shit all rules man.

This release sat essentially dormant on my shelf for years after I bought it (probably because I thought it was a weird metal thing, but also probably because I had four too many dollars that day) until I unearthed it recently and was throttled the same way I was when I first heard Nihiliste(s) in 2009 - the same year B\u00d6KAN\u00d6VSKY released this opus. Each side is a complete journey, but you have to be willing to travel if you want to reach the destination - impossible song construction makes you forget that the first track clocks in at more than a quarter hour, but the final minutes are more than worth the wait. The second movement acts as a cool down from the first, more relaxing/resigned and less determined...until the final 70 seconds suck the air out of you. Calculated and gratuitous, I'm not sure why I like it (or how many points it will cost me), but sometimes it's best to not ask why.

Sonic images of '80s AustroDeutsch dark DIY punk lurking deep in the shadows, never overpowering KETTENHUND's vision but still refusing to leave this form completely.

They hooked up with their pals in FOSSIL FUEL....and pressed record. The result was FOSSIL CUNT - improv grind, inept punk, nonsensical noisecore and offensive adolescent humor set to sound. Worth noting that Matt from FF (and SOCKEYE) was the person who introduced me to AxCx, and the 5346 Song EP was the first noisecore I consciously heard...it was very confusing. There was that one guy with a distro while I lived in Oklahoma who would sling MEAT SHITS tapes but something always seemed sketchy, so I never fucked with him...but I digress.FOSSIL FUEL https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEipt9iOhC8GueE1RrOjgR0CBEeQEJg8OVHqJc9-VpC5ddwDRAqefh2qxLDpFpRMkhEhTfwhyy2WcKRc5whbOZOLBrFUpiRafQ9VdQ4v7jYlBnzVvQetBl8eYcT64qq66wbC2peb6ruSIVuzc0BzFsBPj02RHpx67TRcjnbatWvOaKz6PyEH-8Yi_nEjlA/s1264/Fosil%20C%20outside.jpg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U_Zef_x80g&ab_channel=housepig https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2011/08/fossil-fuel.html https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2020/10/sockeye.html"

I'm not ashamed, per se, it's just that I don't think that most folks would get it, and discussing the brilliance of uncool things is sometimes a thankless task....so why bother. Power pop. It's a tough one for some people, it's a deal breaker for others, but when delivered properly it can be pure perfection. The vocals, slightly out of whack on \"No Remorse\" and straining for that '60s gravel and drive that made EDDIE & THE HOT RODS so damn good even though you knew they were punks. You know what I mean? There's that thing that you can't really nail down but it's fukkn there, and this is why I don't talk about shit like this too often. But seriously, this four song demo is soooooo sick. \"No Remorse\" is clearly the creamer du jour, but feel \"Let's Ride\" kick in and it's almost like you are listening to the ancient groups that M.O.T.O. modeled their existence after (for real thoguh, the start of that track could almost be a rip of \"All Night Vivarin Jag,\" which is the second best M.O.T.O. track ever....\"Gonna Get Drunk Tonight\" is obviously the first).

There's an appeal to the sonic confusion of a barrage of harsh sound that is completely removed from any familiar kind of aural stimulation, but for me it's an appeal that is typically short lived and therefore I can only ingest in small doses. But artists who carefully construct and manipulate the noise and present it in the form of (and within the context of) music are something different entirely. DRAG AGE's swells of grating industrial sound flow like songs, arhythmic and lacking anything approaching a chorus but calculated, deliberate and indeed musical. Terrifying, but musical. \"Blueberry Skull (Night Of Weeds)\" is the standout - desperate notes pleading from behind a wall of relentless sound.\u00a0 PUNISHMENT NIGHT There are several releases in the DRAG AGE arsenal, this one came from the All Hell label and was recorded in 2010. //4.bp.blogspot.com/-N8l-4aZbCmw/UjViF1A2aiI/AAAAAAAAIoU/pV4wQ317bfg/s1600/drag+age+cover+copy.jpg //1.bp.blogspot.com/-LHhg4tx8d8k/UjXVW4mHBdI/AAAAAAAAIok/LM8johVkKug/s1600/drag+age+spine+copy.jpg http://thesodomapple.blogspot.com/"

But what I really like is that kind of music played by DIY punks, because it somehow sounds different and somehow sounds better. That's how ASUNTO PENDIENTE strike me; high energy catchy punk with excessive backing vocals (and whoa-whoas) and that middle ground between pop punk, hardcore, and quality college rock. Countrymen FUZZY skip the high energy hardcore and just go straight for JAWBREAKER styled crooning melodic punk (except on \"Pasi\u00f3n,\" a burner with a driving pogo beat that makes me wonder what else these kids had up their sleeves), and pull it off perfectly without ever sounding like a soulless clone of anything at all.

All of this says to me that GEEN NAAM are just fucking going for it, and the results aren't necessarily predetermined...and that is an honest fukkn band. They play fast, they play strong, and they play punk as shit. Maybe this is a decade old, but it's timeless - and by that, I mean that this could just have easily come from '90s North American basements or late '80s South America....it's actual and international punk. I like punk.\u00a0 \u00a0DEAF, DUMB AND BLIND"

Two absolute burners from ANINOKO - I've said before that they may be the might be the most important band in the Bay Area and I'll say it here again. And \"Tanginamo Trump\" may have been written at the beginning of the collapse, but it serves as a searing warning gone unheeded half a decade later - and 2018's Ugat was absolutely one of the best records I heard that year. Long running Filipino band THE EXSENADORS drop two killer bombs of their own, wildly catchy street punk that delivers the hooks of DEAD HERO with the churning fury of bands like MANKIND? or THE PIST with a nice noise piece at the end of their side. Not surprisingly, the new tape is one of the essentials I'm about to grab from Aklasan...one of many.

Whether by intent or accident, this comes across as a junked out modern interpretation of early electronic dance music, with a deliberate intensity that shines on tracks like \"Eyes Wide Shut\" and the tape's opening (and best) jam, \"Paradise For The Wicked.\" I'm a little late to the game with GEL SET, the second release came early this year and is arguably more excellent than Cell Jets...and it is also just as sold out.

It would be easy to just dig into relic after relic and convince yourself that there was nothing worth listening to anymore, or accept that your relevance has passed, wallow in the basement DIY version of FOGHAT and feel pathetic. Enter DESERTER: by any typical measure, they are fine. It's a pretty rough recording, a small(er) town trainwreck of unintentionally raw epic crust and then-dated basement screamo crammed into a tortured cassette 4-track recorder and topped with leads screamed through a Gorilla 1x8' combo amp. BUT.....it's great. And that's the thing, the pretense is gone and DESERTER are going for it. Not going for the pretense, or the brass ring or the prize or whatever, DESERTER are going for it. And maybe that's the thing...there's not a better or worse, and it's not about importance or irrelevance, these are all artifacts, they are all moments. Maybe they are ours that we share, maybe someone else's that we observe or enjoy, or maybe they simply pass us by.

I was struck when one online review compared the duo to avant/electronic pioneer Nic Raecevic, because the latter's Beyond The End...Eternity from 1971 was the very first thing that I thought of when I let this release set in (honestly, Karoline bought it for me at Bullseye back in '06 and I still listen to it on the regular).

These songs are full of fire - dissonant, chaotic and unbelievably aggressive hardcore that his so much harder than the formulaic DBeat crust that would dominate much of the early part of the decade. They were from Portland, but three members spent the early '90s in ANIMAL FARM, COWARD, DEMISE (and countless others). They clearly dragged their Milwaukee basement roots west with them and the resulting cacophony packs even more power today than it did then. This recording (and the self titled 12\" even more so) is one that makes me just listen, trying to absorb everything that's happening. Rico and Grant trade vocals like they are joining forces in separate battles with separate demons while Russ treats his drums like he wants to fucking murder them. The drum patterns are as erratic as the riffs, and there are times when it sounds like David's bass is providing the only coherent foundation while the rest of the chaos gels. LIVING UNDER LIES lands like a swarm - all of the tonnage that made the hardcore from that era stand out is here (and then some), but you aren't going to hear a track like \"32nd & Hollis\" anywhere else because this band did what the fuck they wanted. So I'll keep listening, jaw agape, mumbling to myself \"fukk, did you hear that?!\" and then I'll probably listen to the whole thing again.\u00a0LIVING UNDER LIES"

Why the fukk not, right? The jams on the XRDM side are total killers, fastcore with serious teeth and bulldozer low end fronted by harsh female vocals with guttural male backups lifted straight from the 625 Productions vault. Only one of their seven tracks tops the minute mark (and that one clocks in at a mere 61 seconds), absolute top quality shit. The NO STATIK side is made up of 2011's No Hospice/Clean Swift Sunshine 45 (vinyl copies from Prank Records) and the Never Be A Martyr single from the following year (long sold out), and our four tracks take up several more minutes than XRDM's seven...perhaps we are getting soft in our old age?

The guitar is so piercing and so gloriously shitty that it's almost hard to tell when tracks like \"Big Dick Crucifix\" launch into breakneck hardcore for a few seconds before they settle into their fierce and snotty groove, while the sheer chaos of \"Future Cop\" rivals greats like FAT DAY for discordant irreverence.

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on May 10, 2019 Description from Terminal Escape: The whole idea of posting mix tapes and compilations on Fridays centered around sharing constructed personal mixes or curated compilations. While today's post is really neither, it is a collection of tracks that were recorded onto one cassette, so it still lives under the same roof, even if the motivation is slightly different. BBC's John Peel and his Sessions don't really need any kind of an introduction, but it bears mentioning that during a pre-internet age (and honestly before a tape trading network) lifelines like this were invaluable. As evidence, here's four batches of tracks presumably recorded off of the radio with little snips of Peel's voice popping in and out here and there, sometimes awkwardly cut off (hopefully by a teenage hand hurriedly fumbling for the pause button in the dark). ALTERNATIVE TV - Four songs, recorded December 1977 This session was released on a compilation LP in the 1990s, albeit in a different order. \"Action Time Vision\" is one of the top UK77 tracks, period. Side note - I keep meaning to check out that ALTERNATIVE TV w/GENESIS P-ORRIDGE recording, because that just seems weird. PENETRATION - Three songs, July 1978 BBC's site indicates that \"Movement\" was also recorded in this session, but it wasn't included on this tape. I feel like PENETRATION are like a life line between X-RAY SPEX and BLONDIE and I celebrate their entire catalog...so hearing this was a treat, especially this version of \"Future Daze.\" THE CORTINAS - Three songs, July 1977 Again, there's one track missing here (and full disclosure: the tape gets kinda warbly during \"Further Education\"), but Bristol's Finest (John Peel's term, not mine) are on fire in this session - check the drum roll in the chorus of \"Defiant Pose\" and fukkn weep. THE RUTS - Five songs, January 1979 \"Savage Circle\" starts this session, and you could be about to launch into a ruthless hardcore assault until...well, until you aren't. The funk is slightly disconcerting, but not as hard to comprehend as how shit hot THE RUTS are on this recording. I feel like SUBHUMANS must have ripped \"Dope For Guns\" at some point, \"Babylon's Burning\" is another essential top track (even though it gets whacked before the two minute mark), and this session has the full John Peel intro. PEEL SESSIONS The tape with these sessions also included a 1977 live set from 999, posted on Escape Is Terminal. All gratitude always to the people who made these recordings, who compiled this tape and thousands more, and who mailed them to strangers and fiends around the world for decades.\u00a0 http://escapeisterminal.blogspot.com/2019/04/999.html"

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on February 07, 2014 Description from Terminal Escape: Look, I already know that posting a 70+ minute noise compilation is a sure fire way to get most of my legion to move the fukk on to whatever other internetting you do to waste your workday (and good job on that day wasting, by the way - your boss is probably an ass and you probably don't get paid enough anyway, so fukk 'em). But for the more adventurous, for the hungry, for the curious, I give you the 2011 Christmas Tree Tape. From TANGERINE DREAM-esque ambiance to bizarre electronic tape manipulations, this compilation had me hooked immediately. Sequenced with care, even the more terrorizing efforts (DR. QUINN MEDICINE WOMAN, THE DAVID RUSSELL SNAKE, 56K, DEAD PEASANT INSURANCE) are palatable when presented between minimal synth (WATCHWORD, TUSCO TERROR, TOUCH SCREEN, RADIO PEOPLE) and some seriously transcendent other worldy shit (OUTER SPACE, COAGULATOR, HEADBOGGLE, MOTH CLOCK). Favorites for these ears are HOWLAND RUSSELL (sparse and brilliant minimal techno), LESLIE KEFFER (analog synths pulsing like mad, \"Caves, Finally\" is mesmerizing), and TROGPITE (somewhere between early CONTROLLED BLEEDING and late '80s Wax Trax Records fodder reproduced 16rpm, if this doesn't trip you out in the dark then your mind is perhaps made of steel). ALLEY VISION, QUICKSAILS, and COLLAPSED ARC round out a well designed collection...those of you who take the plunge will be justly rewarded. As it should be.

Sometimes I go far too long without having my ears shredded live, and sometimes I go days without sitting down (in my case: pacing back and forth) and really listening to records at volume. But I blast these tapes...I rip and/or edit something damn near every night that I'm home, and these built in iMac speakers have pump countless low fidelity hours of DIY punk and noice into my earholes. Sometimes I'm distracted while I'm ripping - work, Murder The Cat, dishes - and the sounds are just kinda 'there' until I edit. But if I'm editing in a hurry I might not spend real time with these little plastic cases until it's their turn to share them here. I'm not proud of the attention that I'm (sometimes) not able to give but.....life gets in the way of living sometimes. Sometimes. Not today, but sometimes. Today? Today I'm listening to TV DRUGS on repeat. I sat down with TV DRUGS whle it was ripping and I got lost while I was editing, wondering how I could describe the magic I was experiencing....apparently I came up with nothing because here I am talking to you about shit that has nothing to do with TV DRUGS, you know? This shit fucking demands attention. This is a 'stop what you're doing and recognize\" kind of tape. I hear '80s California beach hardcore, I keep hearing rockabilly in the double snare hits on \"Medicated\" and speaking of \"Medicated\" there's a desperate MEDICATION TIME energy in the vocals that I am way the fuck into. Urgent '10s North 'Merican DIY stomp vibes creep in with some frequency, but it's tracks like \"Consume\" and \"How Far?' that push envelopes and challenge descriptors. Look, TY DRUGS released a ripping hardcore punk tape back in 2021, pure and simple. Listen properly and you'll get way more than 'just' a ripping hardcore punk tape.

I've certainly blabbed more than enough in these pages to warrant a '90s Reader that will offer more than my fair share of the collective opinion on the matter, and yet the fact remains....the 1990s USDIY punk scene is far too often dismissed horribly misrepresented. The life and genre defining bands that took advantage of the last gasp of organic scene and sound development, before taste makers (and their tastes) went digital, went warp speed, and some element of free thought and expression was replaced with access and emulation. There are countless lost artifacts from that lost decade, and certainly many of them are from bands trying their hand at this punk thing because of something they saw on cable television instead and not because of a crucial mix tape they got from a pen pal's pen pal in Austria who knew about all of the good bands, but this was a time when even those late night no budget music video shows were precious little glimpses into the world that you wanted to touch. Does this mean that every mid-'90s Ohio artifact is an invaluable piece of punk history....? Probably not. It just means that it was, and somehow that context means something.\u00a0 WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ROCK 'N ROLL?!!?!??!

Most noted for his stint in Sun Ra's ARKESTRA, Cohran spent years in Chicago nurturing and playing with younger musicians (Chaka Khan and EARTH WIND & FIRE, to name a couple), curating the Affro-Arts Theater and helping create the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians....there's a lot more to say about an under the radar icon who died last year at 90, but instead I suggest focusing on this brilliant 35 minute long performance - if the purpose was to take the listener on a journey, then mission accomplished.

But even though \"Tag X\" follows with a similar \u00a0melancholy off kilter UK styled punk vibe, they launch into into ferocious rudimentary pogo punk at the three minute mark proceed to tear through two more tunes before slowing down again with \"Justified Rape,\" a brilliantly dreary female fronted number that owes more to dark mental recesses than to fiery punk. The tape continues on this path, teetering between UK anarcho, Deutsch Punk and primitive goth punk, tracks taken from rehearsals, studio sessions and live gigs (and presented with a degree in quality as varied as you would expect). EUTHANASIE had a very limited output during their run (much of which was put to wax by Looney Tunes a couple of years back), but I'm struck by how perfect their mix of sounds is for the current explosion of spiky UK worshipping punks diving into the world of goth and new wave sounds except this is delivered with determination and fire rather than calculation and flare.

You have the people you love and the people you you hate and the choices you choose and the decisions you make...and you have collections of essential hardcore punk music made by people you don't know. Those collections somehow help you navigate all of the other shit - it doesn't make any sense, but that's literally what it's all about. Not sure who first came to this realization (hint: it wasn't me), but that shit resonates. I'm not going to blow a lot of words talking about this tape - it fukkn rules from start to finish and you should listen to this shit and study this shit. I will spend a few words mentioning the essential (QUOD MASSACRE, R.I.P., SUBTERRANEAN KIDS, WRETCHED) and the necessary (RADIKAL HC, TRANSGRESSOR, DEBAUCHERY, L'ODI SOCIAL and basically everything else on the damn tape), and I will once again mention how crucial mix tapes are. How crucial mix tapes have been. How crucial mix tapes will always be. The first version was probably from the late '80s, then the Social Napalm kids reissued it in the 2000s - which means the reissue is basically as old now as the original was when it was reissued. That shit is a trip...and this is the shit. Okay?RIPPING THRASH: THE TAPE"

But making the move from the more commercial, danceable sounds of the then-current records market under the alluring subgenre header to the harsh and primitive origins of the genre was....a challenge. The militant yet accessible stomp of Trudge was easy to get into, which led me to pick up the Tides Of Heaven single (as an exotic import, no less!) on a trip to Denver to visit family. And it hurt me when I listened to it, because I didn't understand. I listened to Towards Thee Infinite Beat, it was trippy and weird and I liked it so I researched...and I was excited when I scored\u00a0The Second Annual Report\u00a0on a school trip to Tulsa and listened to \"Slug Bait\" in the dark...on a school night. As a small town kid, these are formative events. Sonic landmarks. Hearing\u00a0SLE\u018eP CHAMBER as a virgin. These things stick with you. I knew the name TEST DEPT. for years before I was able to spend any time with their output, and even though access is virtually unlimited in the New Era, they are a band that has remained on my mental back burner. Recently, our friend Scott hooked me up with a few tapes when I helped him move, and I was able to sit down with this recording from their 1985 European tour. Back burner no more, I am fucking hungry for this. Feed yourself.\u00a0EUROPEAN NETWORKEverything about this release is superb. The presentation and the experience.

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on August 13, 2015 Description from Terminal Escape: I heard about this band not long after I moved to San Francisco, but they were a band that had existed WAY in the past, an entirely different era. I moved to SF in 1995, so that distant past was really just a handful of years (which of course seemed like an eternity at the time). UNIT PRIDE dropped a demo in '87 that deserves to be placed on the same shelf as countless more revered contemporaries - the thing is rough, but I'll take \"Wide Awake\" over half of YOUTH OF TODAY's output, and the energy here is just right. But then they recorded an EP the following year, and that thing bangs! No qualifiers, no \"well, it's pretty good considering they were from San Ramon and not somewhere cool\" bullshit, that six song piece of wax is deadly. The hesitation from the drums is gone, the tones are honed, the pace never lets up (except for the breakdowns - this is a straight edge band, after all), and \"Wide Awake\" sounds even better than it did the year before. Members of UNIT PRIDE would later play in more famous Bay Area bands REDEMPTION '87, SCREW 32, and NERVE AGENTS, and the internet tells me the guitarist moved to Toronto and played in WOUND UP and PINK EYE (good bands, records readily available in the cheap bins).\u00a0 Today's link has the '87 demo, 11 tracks of rough and intent hardcore, and a plainly packaged cassette from 1988, which seems to be the same recording session as the band's sole vinyl release - six tracks here, and \"All In The Head\" sets the shit off right by letting you know that these kids upped their game from the demo. Maybe there are many bands like this in many pockets of the world...but monkeys keep listening to the same shit over and over instead of searching for the gems. UNIT PRIDE is one of 'em.

You can plant Poland's TISSURA ANI in the same general region as bands like PIXIES (pre-Doolittle) and STEREOLAB, with mid-'80s THE CURE guitar interspersed throughout. But remember the time and place here - I Don't Know was released during the time of ARMIA and EWA BRAUN, and somehow I feel like this tape is a combination of all of those things without owing a debt to any of them. Songs like \"Love\" manage to look 20 years into the future when so much (too much) of hardcore would be looking back at TISSURA ANI's contemporaries and trying to recreate...instead of looking inside and pulling out what's already there. And that, my friend/s, that random and indigestible non-descriptor, that is why I fucking love this tape.

Bluurg released a cassette, All The Madmen had a hand in an EP in 1986 and there's an association with CRASS, but during their 10 year run starting in 1982, these kids mostly released their own stuff and did their own thing (including a pretty hilarious anti-U2 campaign in the late '80s). Halo Of Phlegm was recorded near the end of their initial run and circulated only on cassette until a recent CD reissue (that included other material recorded around '89/'90) and it's all over the place in a glorious way. \"Afraid Of Life\" has an early MISSION/SISTERS vibe, \"AIDS\" might be presented as an interlude but acts as a chill inducing quasi-industrial track, while \"Autonomy,\" \"Cycles Of Christs\" and \"Vandals\" are pretty straight forward punk numbers and \"Death To The Poor,\" \"TV Ads\" and \"Lies\" are hardcore punk burners. Combine this with the drawn out art/goth/anarcho title track and the full recording is more than a little scattered - which is a bit of the charm.

Listen to the fire in the vocals and remind yourself how well suited Slavic language/s are to hardcore, especially hardcore of the cromagnon variety. This demo is on wax now, and should be considered essential modern punk in any and/or all formats.\u00a0 JAD https://jadpunk.bandcamp.com/releases"

NYC '77 (Hell, Thunders, etc), a heavy helping of STOOGES, maybe a dash of M.O.T.O. all fermenting in a sea of Middle America humidity....it goes down like a punk rock 'n roll racket. Lurk clocks in well over an hour, with several tracks taking the time they need to fully develop. It's a fucking rock record made by some dudes in leather jackets, a record with ballads, bangers and attitude for days. Filler? Oh year, some of that too, but if you're going to give me \"Zero Night\" and \"Hard City\" then I'll take your \"Baby's In Hiding\" all day.\u00a0\u00a0LURKFormer MULTIPLE CHOICE bassist Ben \"The Wild Man\" Liman (who preceded me in MULTIPLE CHOICE) passed through their ranks, as did ANCIENT CHIESE PENIS drummer Dan Francis (aka Del Langham and/or Phil McCrevis).

Not exactly the most original name, although I could only find one other band Called Hex (from Italy, old), and one label with the name (Pacific Northwest, current). But in the 1980s world of UK punk, \"HEX\" seems to belong solely to these chaps and their pro animal, anti-government fueled hardcore punk. Like a lot of 80s UK shits, I think that this was probably a few years late at the time, but a quarter century later, this straightforward moody four chord punk suits me just fucking fine thank you. It's not all \"generic\" by any means, \"Food To Conclude\" could be an attempt at a Worlds Apart era SUBHUMANS track, and the killer \"Join Hands\" is mid tempo and dark with guitars drenched in reverb. \"No To The Bomb\" is a more basic four chord rager, which is nice, as I happen to enjoy a nice four chord rager. Four tunes here, no information on the band, except that it's made up of Pikey, Golly, Cubby and Lainy, which might be the untoughest sounding bunch of blokes I've ever come across. Total coincidence, but notice Kim Phuc in the photo on the cover, I just mentioned her a few days ago in reference to the killer demo from KIM PHUC you will find below.

There are hundreds of these. Thousands. Bands that popped up somewhere on the other side of this flat disc we call home, played their hearts out and then moved on or faded away before the geographically challenged had a chance to notice...or, perhaps, bands that took an entirely different trajectory and ended up playing Wacken, like our Indonesian guests BURGERKILL. 2000's Dua Sisi was their first release, and it's very much a hardcore platter, though the roots of the metal powerhouse they evolved into are evident. I suppose if you put the term \"crossover\" in a modern context, this is a perfect example? I just think it's a meaty hardcore platter.....

You are also welcome to choose both.\u00a0\u00a0A dub, likely many generations removed from the original, that includes the searing and essential (and much circulated) 1983 demo and the live in Pisa set from the same year that was tacked onto the more common BCT#5 reissue. Track listing from the live set appears to be a bit different, likely a few things just omitted by the limitations of the generational cassette format, and there are three burners from You Are The Victim tacked onto the end. I often feel that if RAW POWER had just called it after Screams From The Gutter, they would be revered as one of the most important and intense hardcore bands in the world...but when you spend years (decades) touring on records that are basically just \"pretty good,\" it might serve to fog up the view in the mirror when folks are looking back. Regardless, these recordings are simply fucking insane.\u00a0BCT-05Was in the kitchen last night with Karoline and we were listening to a digital radio station dubiously classified as \"new wave.\" Billy Idol was interviewing Miley Cyrus about their favorite holiday songs and playing pandering insipid drivel from RAMONES, DAMNED and BLINK 182. They did play that POGUES song with Kirsty MacColl, but Idol's \"Run Rudolph Run\" was more than enough to kill any shred of enjoyment, and that was before BAD RELIGION's embarrassingly straight cover of \"Little Town Of Bethlehem\" nailed the fun coffin shut. Gratuitous holiday recordings are fucking insulting. This one set me back a quarter, and is easily my least favorite WILLIE NELSON recording. Fortunately, after distorting the hell out of \"O Come All Ye Faithful,\" the tape mercifully gives out a few seconds into \"We Wish You A Merry Christmas.\" Moral of the story is that we should have been bumping punk tapes instead of listening to the radio. Lesson learned (again).CHRISTMAS https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Rb_GVzL0l7I/X-Ymd6r1GhI/AAAAAAAAYnI/DtnrHQoy-s4_feE1ZPtIZFsbTfdMWtRIgCLcBGAsYHQ/s773/Raw%2BP.jpg"

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on October 27, 2011 Description from Terminal Escape: Last year the world was all a buzz about the mighty return of CORROSION OF CONFORMITY. The seminal North Carolina band was going to unleash their '80s fury on eager punks everywhere in the form of the lineup that brought us the Animosity LP. Rejoice!! Gone are the wasted 1990s and the groove metal and the (almost) top 40 hits and the revolving door of sterile \"musicians\" with long hair slogging away on the third tier cock rock touring circuit - C.O.C. are fukkn back!! They booked a west coast tour, and the punks were salivating - we've all seen the videos, and we know the records inside and out - early C.O.C. were the fastest and most sinister thing going. They were from North Carolina (and they looked the part), and the only thing more fierce than Reed behind the kit was Mike motherfukkn Dean with a four string assault weapon strapped to his chest - this band took the BLACK FLAG model, made it faster and re-tooled it for the second coming of hardcore....and they were back. There was a show booked in San Francisco with a ton of bands I was admittedly less interested in, and then I found out that an old friend's band was playing across town - so I skipped the show, convincing myself that it was probably going to suck anyway. It was an easy argument to make; CORROSION OF CONFORMITY had a really killer run, but it lasted only a few years until their first break up, and the two decades that followed are filled with utterly forgettable schlock that a small but determined handful of punks keep trying to make excuses for (no, Deliverance is not \"pretty good for a rock record,\" it totally sucks). 1990s C.O.C. has about as much relevance as COLLECTIVE SOUL, so how could the people responsible for that crap possibly deliver anything other than a novelty punk reunion performance, good only for old timers and ex-punks who haven't seen a hardcore show in years, right? So I was on my way home from my friend's show when I got a message: \"Got an extra ticket to the C.O.C. show - it's yours for free if you want it\" (thanks, Paul), and in an instant all of my self convincing evaporated - \"FUKKN Animosity!!\" so I jumped in a cab. CORROSION OF CONFORMITY 4 track 1985 demo, aka The Good Shit So what's the moral of the story? If you have seen the supposedly-once-again-awesome CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, then you know that they sucked. Sure, they were technically proficient, but it was sterile and limp. Getting a group of accomplished rock musicians to play hardcore is easy - we punks aren't typically virtuosos. But what I saw was a room full of eager fans trying to get excited while three accomplished rock musicians slogged through songs that they seemingly hadn't given a shit about for 25 years, and it was painful. It was the epitome of \"going through the motions,\" a band who can no longer pull an audience with their commercial music falling back on what little street cred they have left to pry another $25 from the wallets of a handful of dedicated hopefuls.\u00a0 ESCAPE IS TERMINAL I started another cassette blog, the world apparently has more cassettes than Terminal Escape can contain. Escape Is Terminal will exclusively feature live recordings, and will be updated 2-3 times a week. Today's post is a C.O.C. set from Washington \u00a0DC, recorded in 1985, when they still had teeth. http://escapeisterminal.blogspot.com/2011/10/corrosion-of-conformity.html"

I think the early grunge parallels are unintentional and/or incidental - a product of shared influences rather than a common goal - just as the Gary Floyd-esque vocals are quite probably the result of a dude filled with soul and going wild more than a band trying to emulate some '80s American punks and the high energy melodic (but still filthy) \"Teenage Spew\" could be a track off the first FACE TO FACE 12\" but still you kinda feel like these kids weren't at all familiar with SoCal bro punk. At its root, this tape is just off the rails punk rock 'n roll, with tons of energy, tons of tempo changes, and a heavy, deliberate rhythm (if not deliberately heavy) section, but when they unleash (as on \"My Nose\" about halfway through this banger) the results are pretty damned killer.

So casual and confident, they just stroll in and just ooze out flawless dreamy fuzzed out noise/pop. Bass lines drive most of these tracks, while guitars swim in the aether, a relationship that bears more than a passing (and extremely flattering) comparison to Fraser/Guthrie circa Blue Bell Knoll, when they really dialed the shit in (I'm probably in the minority there, but you get my drift...). IS/IS veer effortlessly into garage pop on \"Sideways,\" and reaching deeper into their repertoire it seems that this success isn't a fluke, and the band pulls off a brilliant '90s alt/indie number with \"Gleam,\" but their excellence is rooted in the way they approach relatively simple melodies and breathe life and mystery into them. Listen to \"Rune.\" Listen to it a lot. I stumbled on this cassette in a bargain bin and purchased on a whim and a fondness for the cover (don't think I'm a baller, the thing was a dollar), and IS/IS is my favorite accidental discovery in years, even their stabs at a rudimentary grunge rehash are worth your time.

While I'm sure that many lamented the transition from thrash metal (especially the justifiably Bay Area brand) to what would eventually become n\u00fc metal, demos like this are primal and punishing. The pace and attack are more akin to meaty east coast hardcore (the knuckle dragging ignorant kind) than any kind of long haired metal, and the backing vocals on the opening tracks confirm that assertion. Maybe this appeals to me because in high school I revered Cowboys From Hell and Blood Sweat And No Tears equally or maybe the shit just jams, but the whirlwind of \"Again\" is gonna rock me through my ride to work later this morning, shouting \"again and again and AGAIN!\" in my own head...or maybe at full volume while cruising the sleepy morning streets of San Francisco, startling a few well to do joggers and the cross fit crew that meets on Folsom Street.

At the time, they were probably the most prolific and best known Venezuelan DIY punk export and people were more than a little excited to see the dual vocal trio live - which benefitted our single vocal trio handsomely. Solidaridad is a collection of EP and comp tracks all recorded in the late '90s, including their side of one of their two splits with RENUENCIA, which is their rawest (and best, to my ears) material. I'm not going to talk about the time the drummer rolled backwards off the stage and out the door and down the stairs in the middle of a set because I mentioned that a few years ago...SOLIDARIDAD https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2016/07/patia-no-donamaldad.html"

I mean, the cow on the cover didn't hurt, but it was mostly that jangly guitar and endearing adolescent sense of humor masking legitimate social commentary...and some killer tracks, of course. THE JUDY'S weren't as fast or as in your face as their Philadelphia contemporaries, but they were also a little earlier to the dance - 1981's decidedly more new wave killer Washarama dropped a full two years before the first MILKMEN demo. Tracks like \"Joey The Mechanical Boy\" and \"Ghost In A Bikini\" have a DEVO by way of B-52's flare, while much of this 1985 release is just punk-lite presented as palatable new wave...or maybe it was snarky new wave that appealed to punks.

Gonna pump things up a bit because it's Thursday and post a few tapes that were kicking around with no covers...SHUT THE FUCK UP!The Arkansas SHUT THE FUCK UP! The bass/drums/vocals SHUT THE FUCK UP! I posted their (other?) demo a few years ago and the link is still live. This one is just on a commercial blank with a hand written label, but the sound is unmistakable. Thirteen songs here...might be a tape of the EP, might also not be a tape of the EP. Too many tapes too early in the morning to bust it out and check and besides, that band was amazing so there's nothing wrong with having the songs twice, you know?GREG INGRAHAMOne of the coolest artifacts from Pat's immense collection, four instrumentals recorded by AVENGERS guitarist Greg Ingraham in 1984/85. Serious WIPERS vibes on the opening cut, then veering into laid back rock with a(n almost) Fahey bent before the gorgeous closer \"Moon All Alone.\" Someone should re/issue this.\u00a020\u20224 AUGUSTNo idea where this came from - just a loose cassette with a handwritten label that reads\u00a020\u20224 August. Some metal, some prog, some punk, some outsider sounds - an excellent hour of sound with no track listing to guide you. And it's a mix tape...so I'm staying within my self imposed parameters.\u00a0SOUPMore legendary (early) East Bay punk. Karoline told me that the kids in Milwaukee and Madison were all obsessed with this tape, and freaked out when the bass player rolled through their scene on a road trip. I get it, but it doesn't really to anything special for me - I like it as an place in time more than as a sonic experience\u00a0(the tape is an original and well partied - I wouldn't mind if someone could scan me a copy of the cover, just saying). You can absolutely hear the (later) East Bay sound formulating here though, and that bass player drew the cover for\u00a0Dookie.\u00a0THE SKINFLUTESLow key legendary Bay Area band, probably most famous as Sarah Kirsch's first outfit. Later became SAWHORSE (an equally weird but objectively better moniker) and had a killer EP on Ebullition. I posted some of (more of?)\u00a0these tracks\u00a0a few years ago too, but you might have missed it...and this is a different tape.\u00a0CORRUPT YOUTHThere's an OP IVY cover, but most of this demo has a harder, sloppier edge. I feel like I'm inside Mission Records on a sweltering Saturday afternoon in 2001 and I'm watching some band from Missouri playing like their life depends on it.\u00a0LASSIENot to be confused with the German LASSIE, the New Orleans LASSIE are a demented, soulful and angular punk experience - like TELEVISION reborn in the midst of the NWI punk scene of the early 2010s. My tape has a classy and stylish handwritten label but no song titles or anything....if this post demonstrates anything, it demonstrates that a little mystery keeps things interesting.\u00a0 https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2018/08/shut-fuck-up.html https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-skin-flutes.html https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2020/01/lassie.html"

Every time I turned around there was a new bomber from NEUTRON RATS, ACID REFLUX, ANAL WARHEAD, NUCLEAR FAMILY.....or an unearthed early '00s relic like ECFU. It became noticeable enough the Logan put me on blast for prioritizing Albany over Austin (think about that), but it didn't last forever. The last time I toured the East Coast I hit up folks for a show somewhere on the turnpike between NYC and Buffalo, but the word was that most of the punks had moved away....Boston, Chicago, Austin...away from a vast expanse of turning foliage and Middle America mindsets. But that was a generation ago, and I listen to this 2016 PRISON demo wondering if the region is back on the map? This is certainly an offering strong enough to anchor such a resurgence (their 2017 three song banger might pack an even deadlier punch), five tracks of noisy, plodding punk that sounds urgent even if it sounds somewhat time stamped by current trends. The simplicity of the two-riff \"Creep\" as the closer translates as pure fury - it doesn't have to be fancy kids....it just has to be right - with a disjointed guitar lead that has been stuck in my head for days. Let's hope Electric City is turning punk again... PRISON https://newyorkprison.bandcamp.com/"

Not just because I want to see a whirling stench crust band from Okinawa in the flesh, but also because their drummer is Kiku (ex-ASSFORT, ex-CHARM, CFDv.1), one of the greatest dudes on this forsaken planet. I dropped him a line to tell him I was excited to see him....and alas he's only their local drummer - he moved to Okinawa after the 2011\u00a0T\u014dhoku quake and I'm pretty sure the island life suits him, but I digress. The band...was a filthy, murky, downtuned mess, like ENT through a fog, but with the irreverence of SOCIAL PORKS. I was floored, if there is any justice in the world then the 12\" on SPHC will be revered as a classic, and who the fuck bookends a collection of songs like these with damaged Link Wray covers...? SOW THREAT do. Pairing them up with Portland's SUSS LAW was perfect for the tour and for this split - a piercing, hard charging new millennial crust assault drenched in noise. Drums are....well, the shit is fast and everything else is just trying to catch up. Volume, drinking, chaos - not necessarily but very likely in that order.\u00a0 \u00a0EXTREME BRUTALITY NOISE While writing this, I read that SOW THREAT guitarist Tamura passed away earlier this month.

Fronted by deep, gravelly vocals and seasoned with Swedish leads, these kids make it clear that they using familiar elements to create a sound that is wholly theirs. What if S.H.I.T. relied on fearsome power instead of affected guitars and reverb (to be clear, that was not meant as a dis on S.H.I.T. in any way)? What if PROXY skipped the leads, kept the hooks and then played crust? I could easily pick apart my favorite moments on this stellar demo (the half time finish of \"Shameful\" would be near the top of the list), but the transition from \"Invasion\" into \"Reign\" is just a few steps short of Word As Law-era NEUROSIS without seeming remotely contrived, and when that transition is over...?

There's the minimal electronics of SCORPIO & GLASS, a devastating SUICIDE-esque tracks from RITUAL HOWLS, dark dance synth in multiple forms (dirty and ominous: CRAOW, classically self indulgent: PHASE FATALE), a filthy rhythmic industrial collaboration from LIABLE, and BLUE KRISHNA's perfectly placed sample laden cool down track at the end of the tape...there's more, but you need to be listening and not reading my drivel.

Perhaps I didn't fully realize how influential the dude actually was until I started doing this blog thing - between bands we were in together, bands he was in that I dug, and tapes he made me....shit, that monkey was responsible for a pretty huge chunk of my initial introduction to The True Underground. How can one man be responsible for turning a twenty year old onto WRETCHED and JAD FAIR? Exactly. In case you are wondering, only one of those two is on this tape - but he did drop an S.O.B. track from Gates Of Doom on this one, and who the fuck was blasting death metal S.O.B. in Oklahoma 1993? Seriously. That's my point. And this tape was my introduction to LAST EXIT, who are from another planet. So yeah - instead of telling you all the things that are on this tape, I'll just tell you that it opened my mind and my eyes to tons of shit (and helped me find other shit through that shit) and I still cherish it more than two decades after Dan made it for me.

Nowhere near straight forward enough to be death metal, way too metal to appeal to Japanese hardcore purists, and too innovative for anything approaching mainstream attention. Watching them live was like watching an earth mover destroy a playground, casually sucking all of the sugar coating out of life and leaving you with reality, and recorded is no different. On my list of top shows ever: HELLCHILD, DS-13, ARTIMUS PYLE and DDX13 in Joe's Garage outside of Reno in 2000. Not a bad gig at all, and watching Scottzy smoke meth in the loft while convincing a teenage mall punk girl that he was a bad influence and that it would be a bad idea for her to get in the van that was parked across the street...in front of a playground and in broad daylight? That was pretty funny. Only two songs here, and no recording information - just an endorsement and an anecdote. HELLCHILD\u00a0"

I like when I can't tell if a success is accidental or intentional, and that's definitely the case with KNOW SO, whose demo took the exit for Awesometown about three clicks from Suck City, USA. \"No Patience\" is pure brilliance - it's not the way I work, oh no, I got a lot of fukkn shit I wanna do - and it makes me think that they actually meant to do this.

Quintessential epic crust...riffs for days, a constant low end heavy chug, and a singer with a rasp well worthy of the Northwest elite. If nothing else, HIVE stands out for the intensity and speed they bring to the game - even the slower, more melodic bits (\"Reversal Of Fortune\") will have you clenched tight...the knife edge that this band straddles creates a legitimate tension with even a casual listen. Comparisons aren't really necessary, but if you monkeys like the sound of a black clad apocalypse with full stacks, then here you go.

One of the last shows of that tour was in San Jose with ALL YOU CAN EAT (who were at that point, at least to newcomers like us, already stalwarts of the Bay Area Scene - they had toured overseas and members worked for Maximum Rocknroll for fukks sake!) and Boise, Idaho band HAGGIS (who had something cool written on the side of their van, even though I can't remember what it was). It was classic early DIY touring - the dude who \"set up the show\" showed up late and all the bands just hung out on the sidewalk with some local punks in front of the venue in downtown San Jose until he got there...and we told him the venue was locked. Turns out he hadn't exactly asked anyone if he could do the show there, he was just kinda hoping they would be open or some shit, so we convinced him (or guilt tripped him) to find a house where we could have the show. Wait....did I say house? I meant apartment - like in an apartment complex. So even though it seemed we were gonna play mostly for each other (you want to romanticize touring, young punks? because playing for the other bands at the show because no one knows who you are and no one bothered to stop watching tv to come see you play....? that's what touring is really about)\u00a0but we double parked and were all working like a team to load shit in to this apartment and set up in the living room. And then a cop drove by as we were pulling the bass cabinet out of the van and he stopped and he looked at us as if to say \"what the actual fukk do you think you are doing?\" and we all kinda assessed the situation and thought \"yeah, this shit ain't never gonna fly\" and so we loaded the gear back in the van/s. So yeah...that's how I met HAGGIS, and that's how I became friends with ALL YOU CAN EAT.\u00a0 SL9 demo But if you want to listen to this 1996 demo, and you should, then you are in for a fukkn treat. I mean, if you like melodic 1990s punk. But the good kind....not the mindless generic bullshit. Guitars that bridge a gap between Flip Your Wig and early '90s Bay Area (note: original HAGGIS guitarist was ex-SEPTIC DEATH...according to The Internet), and the kind of gravel drenched vocals that make the era so easy to apologize for. I asked Karoline for comparisons and she mentioned CRIMPSHRINE and SCHLONG and JAWBREAKER and Hayes-era Lookout! and I don't disagree with her at all even though I have completely different reference points (like: DEAD MILKMEN playing high energy pop punk through 1985 H\u00dcSKER D\u00dc's gear without changing the settings). The main thing though, is that SL9 holds up extremely well in the face of an overly judgmental and/or compartmentalized internet. These songs are absolute burners - and if you can sing along and there's a story to go with them....? Well then that's even better.\u00a0"

I did this for obvious reasons (I mean...tapes, right?), but also because you never know what kind of conversation/s might result from a request like that. Unless you count the HOT LOAD tape packing in an envelope with a joint that was delivered by a UPS driver in Pomona, folks only came through twice. Some bangers from a nice couple in Morro Bay (y'all came by in Los Osos a few years ago too, you should send me your address and I'll send you something nice) and a bloke in Eugene who lingered around the table on and off for a chunk of the show while we talked about lots of shit - including the batch of tapes he brought by. Fellow has an interesting focus: Christian punk and alt. Curiously, we didn't delve into the ethics or the why or the conflicts or really any of the background at all, I just asked questions about the bands and their connections, much like I would when talking to any expert in a field about which I know....nothing. The other tapes he handed off will likely pop up eventually, but LIFESAVERS comes first - classic '90s indie/alt sound that reminds me of TEENAGE FANCLUB, THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, THE SMITHEREENS and the like - even touches of later JAMC from time to time. Everything sounds slower and more laid back (read: more accessible) than it should (\"Surf With God\" in particular) - almost like the cool neighbor is trying to make sounds that the elders will approve of, but will still lure the bad kids to youth group on Wednesday night. Take the lone burner \"Skate\" for example: My skateboard is no crime / There's hungry children cryin' / There's politicians lyin' // The crime I see Mr. Police is this world don't know where to go when it dies. See what they did there? No doubt, Poplife\u00a0sounds familiar and comfortable even when it lands pretty flat sonically, but...it was an interesting conversation and one that I hope to continue at some point.\u00a0POPLIFE"

There was a time in the mid-1990s where I think FUCKFACE pretty much only listened to the APEFACE split, Trained To Serve and Rebel Sounds Of Shit And Failure, and I still spend time with all of that music on a regular basis. Whisper's vocals are the perfect collision of shrill urgency and harsh, determined screams - Stacy (MANKIND?) is maybe the closest era-appropriate vocal comparison, but ZERO HOUR were so undeniably East Bay (ECONOCHRIST drummer Markley's presence on these songs cannot be ignored) and their intensity always seemed to be darker, directed toward inner torment instead of general injustice. Chris unearthed this tape a few months ago, well worn and pretty destroyed in places, but many of the tracks from the split and the self titled EP are in excellent form on this January 1994 rehearsal, along with a couple I don't recognize...and if nothing else, it made me pull out all of those records.

The guitar is the first thing you notice with L-PLATES; distorted and affected in a way that is equal parts teenage thrash demo and Ahead-era WIRE. Drop that sound in to a dual vocal adult anarcho assault and you get something that is noteworthy at worst (\"Our Fixture World\" and the eponymous second track), but stop-and-take-a-listen-no-really-pay attention! at it's best. The recording sometimes masks legitimate burners like \"M.O.A.B.\" and \"My Twilight Zone,\" while several numbers come off like a Spiderleg band born one decade too late. But \"Civilian Depopulation\" is the track. It's when the seemingly random '80s WIRE comparison popped into my head (though on this one it's as much the vocals as the guitars), and it's just a really well crafted and engaging song. So skip L-PLATES because it's not on the back of your cool friend's vest, but remember that your cool friend probably makes fun of you when you aren't around. So question, change, and use your mind.

Dub Ditch Picnic has been an under the radar favorite at TEHQ for several years, the kind of label that makes you feel comfortable parting with your dollars in exchange for new sounds because the imprint on the shell was a symbol of quality. Of confidence. The engine behind the label was Chris Jaques, who passed away at the tender age of 50 back in April....the catalog is still available digitally, the catalog is recommended, Jaques' efforts are (still) appreciated, and I'm still going to scoop up Dub Ditch Picnic releases whenever I come across them. As for AURA LEVEL FOUNTAIN....it's the sound of a fitting sendoff, honestly. Light and gentle sonic breath with a distant but determined ominous undertone. Three tracks that span nearly one hour.

The bands are completely different, but it's the same way I sometimes feel about Markley's drumming in ECONOCHRIST - a rock steady four on the floor with a looseness around the pace instead of within it. Most of you are going to notice the vocals, and that's okay because they are in your face and full of fire. Some of you are going to pay attention to the guitars instead and that's okay too because they are a swarming duo of no bullshit North American hardcore riffs and they are exactly what I need today.

Mexicali's DISSLATE fill these eight minutes with a raw fury rooted in DBeat/crust, but they ramp everything up to such an extreme that there seems to be nothing left but sheer power. They start to crack here and there, as on \"Demasiado Guapos (Para el Punk),\" but it's those moments that make DISSLATE seem real, and draws even more attention to their ability to deliver a full hardcore assault. If you aren't sold by the intro to \"Alguien Como Tu\" then you need to have your pulse checked....and if you aren't moshing when the breakdown drops in for the last 15 seconds of the song then I just don't know if I can help you at all.\u00a0 NUEVO SISTEMA https://disslate.bandcamp.com/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-a2aQ5vxi_9A/W9cerRb2MWI/AAAAAAAAUGw/0AcGuu0Zc_sNinBNltObXRmEqA_4rEOdQCEwYBhgL/s1600/Disslate%2Bimg2%2Bcopy.jpg"

We stopped by Ebullition on a trip to Los Angeles in 2010\u00a0(it's not on the way, no matter how many times I've tried to convince myself it is because driving I-5 is annoying) and I bought a couple of things as we were delivering records. Lisa smirked a little when I told her I had no clue what I was buying while she logged the DOLCIM tape...it just looked vaguely interesting and it was only a few dollars and, well, the compulsion can be strong I suppose. But I'm sure she understood. The tape got misplaced somewhere in the van on that tour and it stayed missing for some years (don't judge me) before it made its way into the house with a box of chud during a recent spring cleaning session. What had been a new release when I acquired it, was added to the shelf as a(n almost) decade old sonic relic from a lived lifetime and an expired scene. And eventually, I listened.\u00a0Guillotine Ride\u00a0came to life as one of those recordings that stops you in your tracks - like, you don't even remember what you were doing when you put it on, you just know that you stopped doing whatever it was and you didn't do anything except listen. Until it was finished. The recording is massive and oppressive in its presentation, the quiet parts are few and are your only opportunity to exhale and reload. Steeped in metallic and chaotic European screamo adjacent hardcore bands like ACME and CELEST(e), DOLCIM still draw from their statesmen (I swear I hear Nightmares-era Boatright in the vocals) and use these influences as references instead of blueprints. Like the influences are merely a roadmap to help get them to their destination. Their journey to me was long, and most of it was spent in the dark recesses of a van that leaks too much and is starting to mold on the passenger side headliner...but the vessel was enough, and for that I am grateful. I'm sure you understand.\u00a0GUILLOTINE RIDE"

By most accounts, punk started to take root in Indonesia in the mid-90s, and the scene was almost synonymous with the student activists who rose up against the Soeharto regime. Not surprisingly to fans of Third World punk and hardcore Tian An Men 89 Records was there, and released Injak Balik! as a compilation EP in 1997, featuring some of the earliest DIY bands from Bandung, West Java. Noisy pogo punk (RUNTAH, DEADLY GROUND), gruff street hardcore (PUPPEN), raw metallic crust (JERUJI, SAVOR OF FILTH), some nasty sounding mincecore (CLOSEMINDED), and a few blasts of intense and hopelessly catchy punk (TURTLES JR., PIECE OF CAKE), plus ALL STUPID's absolute ripper \"Sia,\" a sub-60 second primitive hardcore masterpiece. Releases like this don't just deserve to be reissued in physical form, they need to be in punks' hands and in their ears. This punk was urgent punk, it was important, and the context is integral to its creation and its very existence....so keep digging, because the more you learn about punk, the more you'll find that you need to learn.\u00a0 INJAK BALIK! http://tam89records.com/home.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdwiJaKk-k"

Lots of live tracks, some tunes from records you might have if you are a collector scum, SIB, 5\u00ba BRACCIO and NY RAVERS are probably my favorites on this tape, although the RATTUS and TERVEET KADET tracks are pretty unfukkwithable. And remember ADMASS, those inept UK punk miscreants who made a pair of of yawn inducing appearances on The Escape? Yeah, they made it onto this tape filled with '80s international heavyweights, and Gary Bushell is still a cunt. RAW WAR My copy came to me sans cover, and thus sans track listing.

Shades of '90s Gravity Records, a childlike admiration for SONIC YOUTH and adolescence spent listening to Midwestern hardcore and East Bay punk...these are all things that I imagine helped create TOTAL TRASH, but the band could just as easily be an earnest and filthy modern grunge/indie outfit cranking everything up louder than it should be...or a perfect accident. \u00a0You Don't Try is infinitely cleaner than last year's self titled release, but these hooks are still being bashed out with the subtlety of a jackhammer - and yet still the hooks are there. \"Daddy Imarichgirl\" is faster and more intent this time, while \"Bugz\" is the hit, a dreamy upbeat and hopelessly infectious number with off kilter (and ever so slightly off key) vocals that is followed by most determined and angry dirge that TOTAL TRASH have offered up thus far to close out the tape.

But fuck man, two tape blogs is enough and I'm not gonna start a youtube channel so all of this shit is just going to live...here. Ninety-three minutes of radio recorded in by Pat Wright - seems to be mostly from an FM station in Middlebury, Vermont though it's labeled 1970 - N.Y. Radio. He listened to (or mistreated) the original tape enough that he had to reload it into a new shell somewhere along the line, and it's easy to see (hear) why. Plenty of songs and artists you already know, but hearing LOVE SCULPTURE, MARMALADE and TAJ MAHAL played on the same level as MOUNTAIN and the STONES is still pretty cool.

Come to think of it, that's exactly what this blog is for.\u00a01970 - N.Y.

Maybe these sounds are pass\u00e9 to some, but these sounds are very very real to me, and even though I might go days (or weeks) without ever pointing my index finger to the sky and silently singing along to something that once meant something greater, it just takes a few seconds of loosely blasting drums and powerfully catchy guitars to remind me how much this shit moves me.

Malta's VALDALS open the tape with a blistering \u00a0metallic thrash punk assault, sharing the first side with Paraguay's KAOS offer up mid tempo lurching Latin American punk that could have come from 1983. INFLATE hail from Moldova and come off somewhere between accidental goth punk and snotty garage weirdness - I can definitely hear him say \"Fukkn fukkr, I'm fukkn drunk\" and \"Punk Punk Punk Punk Punk Punk Punk Punk Punk Punk, red wine,\" though most of the lyrics are a little tough to work out. Accidentally eerie garage sounds from Bruneis' PINK DAEMON (might be the best on the tape after repeat listens - such a weird vibe on this track), and and a Spanish language scorcher from EL BOSQUE representing Costa Rica. I know many folks who tend to write off\u00a0TAM89 releases, chalking them up as a novelty label more concerned with geography and quality, but I think Luc is more concerned with community than anything else, and even though sometimes his releases don't melt faces, they are almost always far more relevant than whatever flavor of the month the kids are listening to. This time, the quality is as over the top as the achievement.

Sounds you are already familiar with, but sounds that feel new again, sounds that feel important again. \"Decay\" is the banger: starting with a squall of feedback and a UK82 drumbeat, then the low end rumble introduces the searing guitars and affected vocals to carry us through until a breakdown that screams filthy Oakland warehouse 1993 cuts the tempo in half only to have the song lurch back into gear with a brilliantly simple and piercing guitar lead - the whole thing is a killer, but that song is a fukkn classic.

And the xylophone solo totally makes sense, which is even weirder. IVES reminds me of those (almost punk sounding) early Norwegian black metal bands I heard in Aesop's room in 1995, which I think is their point. Not that IVES know who I am or that I lived in Aesop's room, but that they would like to sound like those seminal bands...except for the first few seconds of the title track where they would like to sound like MITB (super weird, but compared to a xylophone solo, not really that shocking).

I kinda want to dissect every part of it, but it would be impossible to pull it off without sounding like a dick. I will say that \"Treacherous\" reminds me of a SUBHUMANS song that has never existed (but should have), and the drums in \"Wrong Side\" are possibly without parallel. And since I've already started....\"Pain Is Entertainment\" should have been a POISON IDEA song in 1987, same with \"Don't Come Closer.\" \"Deadly Present\" sounds way hotter here than on the demo, total Lanchy level riffing...\"Barbwire Noose\" too, something about the way that opening riff descends that makes you want to jump out of a window. \"Kidnapped\" is untouchable California hardcore with a deadly infectious chorus, and \"Trouble\" makes you wonder how hardcore would be is '80s Orange County \"punks\" had been misanthropic freaks instead of surfers with good hooks.

Maybe these tunes delivered today might sound a little \"dated,\" but in 1985, this combination of '80s UK hardcore, unwaveringly fierce politics and a steady diet of early anarcho punk resulted in an amazing demo (and a few stellar records that followed). The guitar tone is fukkn textbook, it's the kind of sound that bands should walk in to the studio with, play it for the engineer and say: \"Make me sound like that\" (seriously, just the intro to \"Time To Jump\" could be cloned and repeated and the result would still be better than most of the records released today). Who would have the nuts to record \"Coca-Killer\" today? And if someone did, then they would more than likely just be called idealistic twits (as GENERIC may well have been back then), but the song is dished out with pure sincerity and comes off not preachy, but rather factual. GENERIC first appeared on Terminal Escape via the North Atlantic Noise Attack\u00a0compilation, but these tracks completely smoke that stuff - this just crushes me. Enjoy.

About half of the tracks are midtempo plods, occasional single note UK82 leads and some undeniably catchy bits, but when the first pure ripper drops in you're bowled over with a maelstrom of rumbling fury - and this is what I like (\"Vota\" is the purest example, and it's not surprisingly the choice cut on the tape).

But never mind the stories and the self congratulatory back slapping and dive right back into the mix with Budapest's NORMS. There are NINPULATORS personnel involved in this trainwreck so the level of quality should come as no surprise, but this shit is seriously dark and exceptionally compelling in a way that a mere collection of ill riffs cannot even approach. The scream of \"ANTISOCIAL!\" in the demo's opening track sets the stage for eleven minutes of mental abuse disguised brilliantly as destructive hardcore punk.

While interest in this event waned almost as soon as we got the thing off the ground, some seriously powerful collections of sound resulted from our experiment. This tape came from one Mr. Sirek, and features some seriously jarring noise and power electronics...but instead of just spending 90 minutes pummeling the listener (which would be relatively easy to do within the realm of noise) Sirek reigns through subtlety and skill. A consistent assault from CHAOS AS SHELTER is followed by VERTONEN's mesmerizingly calm ode. A SWANS by way of black metal excursion from SKY BURAIL is tempered by the sparse and hesitant peace of NIPSEY RUSSELO and ENVENOMIST. Positively brilliant tracks from LUASA RAELON and BENEATH THE LAKE are worth the entire cassette on their own, and incredibly brutal pieces from STROM.EC and AUBE ensure that any calm derived from peaceful interludes will be short lived. There is indeed an art to crafting a mix tape, and I dare say that crafting a noise mix tape is a decidedly more daunting challenge....Sirek did well.

It might have been in the summer of '94 while he was on tour with DALTONIC and we crossed paths in Iowa, both of us opening for AVAIL for a few days...but I can't really remember if the dude I'm thinking of was in fact Dale (footnote 1). It might have been in the spring of '95 at FAT DAY's house in Boston (Somerville, to be precise), meeting new friends on the strength of nothing more than a phone number on the insert of a record in a $1 bin (footnote 2). But I know that we hung out with Dale once and he was a total nerd in the most awesome way possible, just having a blast and not giving a shit about what was cool or how he was perceived and the absolute epitome of \"down to earth.\" And then I know that we came to Massachusetts in 1996 (when we lived with FAT DAY for a full week, but that's a different story) and Dale was at the show in roller skates (true story) and that is likely where he gave us this tape. My point, though fuzzy at best, is that the dude was chill as fukk and super fun to hang out with and is a perfect example of the people you meet on tour, who make that tour better, and who then fade into memory. I have no idea where Dale is today, how Dale is today, or what Dale is doing today, but I thank him for being a friend to four dudes who needed one and didn't necessarily deserve it. I also thank him for this mix tape (footnote 3), more people should make mix tapes for bands on tour. If today's bands don't have cassette decks in their vans then that's their problem. DON'T BLAME ME, I VOTED FOR DALE SHADBEGIAN footnote 1: While I do not know if the dude in question was Dale (though I am pretty sure that it was), DALTONIC's other roadie was the singer from CONVERGE. Fast forward to sometime in the mid 2000s at Gilman (half a country away from where we had originally crossed paths), I was selling books at a matinee CONVERGE show and said hello to the guy selling merch (it was the singer). He hesitated only briefly and then remembered precisely where and how we had initially met (and when we initially met I was clean shaven, which should give anyone who knows me an indication of just how long ago it really was). My mind was blown, I can barely remember people I met last week. Also, AVAIL was not the slightest bit excited to have us in tow for those few shows. footnote 2:\u00a0The\u00a0Live Poultry Fresh Killed EP\u00a0is\u00a0arguably the wisest dollar I have ever spent. And that phone number was OAK-SAGA, some things stick with you forever. footnote 3: About the tape: A lot of exactly what you might expect from a young, enthusiastic DIY punk in the mid '90s. A lot of political hardcore and crust with a predictable predilection towards the East Coast. Lots of classics that you need to listen to more often (seriously, how long has it been since you blasted DEFORMED CONSCIENCE....? What?! Fuck that. Time to dive in, kid), but among mandatory bands from that era of US DIY punk and blasts from lesser known (but no less awesome) contemporaries, there are plenty of tastes from starter bands that you might expect a younger punk to pepper a mix with - and who is going to complain when SLAYER and DEAD KENNEDYS come barreling out of their speakers? Dummies, that's who. Bonus points for the VENTURES and CHEECH & CHONG tracks and the field recordings from the psychiatric rest home, this is a brilliantly crafted mix, streamlined for road listening. Recorded with purpose, delivered with kindness, this is the stuff that is important. //2.bp.blogspot.com/-Zwt4bQvAmUY/UkUVIBojtqI/AAAAAAAAIsg/h-oqjQpamYc/s1600/dale+shadbegian+cover+copy.jpg http://terminalescape.blogspot.com/search?q=somerville //1.bp.blogspot.com/-PGebiVUa4u0/UkUdEKA5yII/AAAAAAAAIsw/DhSpnBLohUc/s1600/dale+shadbegian+img+copy.jpg"

I miss sitting just to the outside of a tight knit scene that defied the disconnect of a massive megalopolis. I don't miss the traffic....but thankfully I get to bask in that steel and concrete glory in my current locale. And I miss the bands. The bands from the north side, the bands from Pilsen, the bands from the NW suburbs and, more notably after I left, the emergence of the NWI punks...they never seemed to isolate themselves, and it wasn't just new bands every time you blinked - it was good new bands. This 2013 comp gives you just a quick taste of what I (we) have been missing by not paying attention to the North Coast; DECAY AFTER DEATH's Mot\u00f6rGoth/DBeat hybrid sets a bar so monumentally high, and then stalwarts POPULATION, CEMETERY and STARING PROBLEM keep killing it before handing over the rest of the cassette to outfits that were new (to me) when this thing dropped. MAC BLACKOUT BAND, HAWAIIAN PUNCH, idXed, SLAG, KRANG, MORAL VOID and manic thunderous bass/drums grind from DIE TIME....everything on this tape rules.

Another eight from\u00a0CITA ATTIEKSME, the most basic punk outfit of the bunch, flirting with earnest DC hardcore.

Some by choice and some by force, some celebrating an arbitrary \"holiday\" and some just taking advantage of a commercially coopted holiday and enjoying solitude and relative quiet. Without getting into the complicated and shitty baggage associated with this \"holiday,\" I will just acknowledge that there are a lot of ragers in this country who, by Saturday, realized that they don't actually like their families all that much and are looking to get out of the house, get fukkd up, and listen to some ripping tunes...and it's for these people that I offer today's cassette. It's a mystery, it's an adventure...and it fukkn shreds. It came in a shell for EMPTY's 1994 All Alone demo (which I thought I had, and I still want...hint hint), but the handwriting on the tape said DERANGED, ARMOOROS, MORAL DECAY, CAMEL CLUTCH + more! but after some sonic research I'm pretty sure I can only pick out the ARMOROS tracks and I surely don't hear any MORAL DECAY. Six bands appear to have made their way onto the tape - A) Ripping old school death thrash. This might be DERANGED, but I couldn't place any of the tracks. B) Pretty sure this is ARMOROS (thanks internet, I had never heard of them) - killer '80s Midwest DIY meets classic thrash metal - I'm into it. C) Technical power metal - kinda like SLOUGH FEG from another dimension. Less operatic maybe (and yeah, I know that SLOUGH FEG are already from a different dimension), but way way out there. D) Just one track here, neanderthal death sludge reminiscent of ASBESTOS DEATH but with savage vocals. E) Maybe the most professional sounding thing on the tape - colossal thrash/death metal that sounds like '90s SEPULTURA at times...but mostly just sounds fierce as fukk. F) Whoever put this together saved the best for last....four doses of absolutely brutal grindcore. Relentless and primitive savagery. Definitely not MORAL DECAY. So there you so...something to blast in your cousin's man cave while you avoid talking about politics with Uncle Lynn and get uncomfortably fucked up on cheap wine by yourself and dread going back to work on Monday.

There's a couple of EPs kicking around so perhaps you are already hip, but if this is your first taste then I suggest you prepare your palate for stripped down and fiery hardcore in the spirit of the 1980s Midwest delivered the way that only Scandinavians seem to be able to pull off these days (and by \"these days\" I am referring to the last decade or so). Eight minutes of attack presented with guitars perfectly suited for a garage rock burner and hooks galore, but with a fury more akin to the kind of hardcore that makes to question whether you should get amongst the madness or watch from a safe distance.

They had a relatively short run in the late '90s with just two releases in their catalog so it's easy to see how they eluded discovery for so long (plus they were from Indiana - nothing against Indiana, but lots of stuff from there flies under the radar).\u00a0Pogrom is a serious blow to the senses though, and it's not often that a blast from an unknown past hits this hard right out of the gate. It's from 1998, so the surge of heavy, powerful,\"fully realized\" hardcore was already overtaking the scrappy and earnest mid decade DIY sounds, but ILLITHED were holding fast and injecting that new energy into their sound while still embracing their Midwest basement foundation (I'm just assuming they played in basements, because it makes sense). Guitars are crunchy and loose, songs erratically incorporate elements of heavy chug but never sound like anything other than a determined, dirty DIY band, and the vocals (all of 'em) are the embodiment of '90s emotional hardcore. This band hits like ANIMAL FARM, ECONOCHRIST, DEMISE...this is the good shit.\u00a0POGROM"

Im (not) sorry, but one is a simple continuation of the other, and the importance of the former's place undeniably helps describe the starting point of the latter....so: In early 2013 NO STATIK went on a (short) tour that culminated with a show in Oakland. It was a ripper - PERMANENT RUIN played and they were at their most fierce. C.R.A.S.H. jumped on the show (and played first, in case you ever wanted to check the legitimate humility of a James Beard Award winning chef in action). The short lived freak show COPS, and REPLICA was straight fire. Every band was shit hot and the crowd was awesome...it was one of those affirming nights that remind you exactly how awesome this punk thing can really be. RAD hadn't really been down to SF/Oakland much, we all knew how ripping they were, but it was the first introduction for a lot of people at the show. There was one lanky longhair wilding out in the pit during their set; dude was having a fukkn time, but he was kinda harshing the mellow of some of the people in attendance...a bump here, a slam there, maybe he was wearing a NIRVANA shirt or some shit, and people were starting to give him mean mugs. And then RAD vocalist Lori, perhaps because she is awesome or perhaps because she sensed the vibe tide turning, took a moment between songs to introduce the rager to everyone at the show. \"Hey!! This is **Tom. He came down with us from Sacramento and he's having a really really good time - hopefully you can all have a good time with him!\" (or something to that effect). And instantly, the vibe changed. **Tom was now the fukkn center of the party, and the energy level of the room leapt off the scale as everyone (and seemingly, it was everyone) was in the mix with **Tom leading the charge. Things stayed amazing after RAD played, maybe they even got better, but I still credit Lori and RAD with making sure that night started great and stayed great, and it was one of my favorite NO STATIK shows.\u00a0 SICK BURN SICK BURN are three of the four people in RAD, and they play like they never missed a beat. These people are, in all honesty, fukkn RAD.\u00a0 Eight songs in as many minutes, blending brilliance and irreverence with high energy thrash 'n roll. Think early '00s acts like RAZORS EDGE, but with just enough California sprinkled on top. Highest regard for the people and and the sounds they make.\u00a0 ** I have no clue what the dude's name actually was. But \"Tom\" seemed to have a nice ring.\u00a0"

The opening chords of \"Divided\" on 1987's Too Much Pain sound like HICKEY playing AC/DC, and the riff that follows is a hardcore scorcher that would be at home in the N.O.T.A. catalog...and then\u00a0the dudes launch into a primitive thrash metal assault that absolutely must be heard. The demo is a straight killer from start to finish - tracks like \"Out For Yourself\" manage to combine DC hardcore circa '81 with Bay Area thrash circa '83 and it's all so brilliantly raw and untainted by success or money...and \"Victim\" will smoke any of the other tracks on the as-yet-unreleased Bloodstains Across Upstate New York comp (I'm talking to you, Biff, these fools were from Elmira). In addition to the Too Much Pain tape, this post includes the notably rawer Why? and Nothing For Nothing\u00a0demos, both from 1986 (the latter is a life affirming exercise in rough, primal hardcore/thrash). These sounds are pure, just listen to the vocals that come in over the end of the solo in \"Shattered Silence\" and you'll surely agree that it's the gnarliest shit this side of VOID, even if the band thought they were playing thrash metal. If the rest of Alex's bag is as good as this shit, then we are all in for some insanely crucial jams.

The intensity was raw, pure. The guitars were loose because the songs themselves were leaping out of the grooves and the guitar sounded like it was trying to fucking escape. It was inner brutality, the heaviness that I was looking for was trapped inside this band....and I couldn't understand what it was that I had missed the first time.

As far as I can tell, Worceter's ALIENATION were a blip in late 1980s UK punk - when wild thrash and ugly stench were taking over the grooves and the anarcho punks were...well, simply not making as many interesting records as they had been just a few years prior. Greatest Hits (1987) is a band who might be trying for commercial success - kinda dark wave and/or post punk but their shot lands somewhere between endearing and off target (check the vocals in the verses of \"Live A Lie 'Til You Die\" and let's cringe along together). There are great moments here, and this vision taken to its ultimate potential could have been something special (\"Vicious Circle\" in particular). What ALIENATION did after that however is truly special - on 1988's Yeah, That'll Do they lose the bass and really hone their approach. Vocals are less in front of the mix but more controlled (read: more intense) and the guitar work is abrasive and overbearing; it's like they just decided to cut all of the bullshit and created urgent punk with a deep and frustrating edge. And then....well, as far as I can tell, that was it.\u00a0GREATEST HITS Vol.II (1987)YEAH, THAT'LL DO (1988) https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgv3p8ujGcDH8z5phChGgfr9VXrEs4LIjvlQkjcBwLtJdXi1qOBHSql7lnX_gJlEi8Zp3KciZjUaqXCUy2osbLpuhVmME_BUun2CCcc3vz1fIsvDn_8fpp1JD1vvGKvG4MqE3BGQ2nUgXiMMxegZp-evS5fDGd_x-yrrMWpCcSRZCHOYc1VmQ867ugLhw=s802 https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe_65WoIO4FbdyBNIk2GeEWsxHzXDZa5rv5zrF9Fl5jmSsuDM8CNpF8N1ZYiscGdNWEIwC6j13aPOen0oJmbAbevNu-0SevhWvPBUbEIPqMt0e-8CrEPccgkY0iQrNHCSHkyYTgg6_JsmjDAlzhw6bGuUqAsj30JETMBrSdATWQ7jHSoVm2FSL3DgR3Q=s620 https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgYcOOIRbDSG-RQfEBfH8KbUNqFmGAwFUn-k7H5rENtE85fM7Q9NleyLcKtgzq_WNZFep3x9qdVTDZc497KrnElRfJ965kVpSHfPg1adLxCdmcc1B5GlZONKRUis-xNuyIaT1uM1zLR6HDgkOoE17SQdCADm6OAZV3pcGJnRRWH-a7XZvFdV8cAkjCQuw=s642 https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi93uvliErWp7nUg7i2JyQgu_E1a_SS1x6d8LGTO2nIaU1BnsXbC6GOAHNGn0UTXCVqCO4EJHqLOpe5hQ--btpVgnACEqCZLStaKn7ATTlkdj9Fm2MrUuYzSq1jQkLddef_K-ovk_kuZeOP_3JVsBI518elIYGSvGpdkXrpkvMZ2YUcKkgCEhKW_O8jDg=s1067"

I don't remember the details, but I feel like they were booked on a different show and there was some drama related to the other band so they righteously bailed. There had been a New York Times thing written about PERFECT PUSSY that week or something, shit is fuzzy but I feel like it was definitely a \"thing\" that they dropped off of the show. The singer had been in SHOPPERS\u00a0and I had really dug on that tape...and really that's about all of the nuggets related to that night and this tape that I remember. It was a killer show, and PERFECT PUSSY ripped - the damaged melody was a nice break from the all out fury from the rest of the bands (NOMAD, CREEPING DOSE and GRUDGES, all of whom were straight fire) - and the whole show was really damn good. I feel like I might have passed out in a car outside St. Vitus that night I also might be remembering a different night. I'm an old man, after all. Last weekend B gave me a box of tapes at practice - he said, \"most of these are from the time when NO STATIK was playing and touring, so you might have a lot of them.\" I had a few but I didn't have this one, so I heard recorded PERFECT PUSSY for the first time yesterday and you know....? Shit is excellent. They are so damn catchy, damaged in furious in a way that completely transforms them - just complete urgency in presentation with hooks ripped (discretely) from late '80s college alt. Obviously this tape connected me to a fountain of memories and for that I am grateful, but as a simple collection of four songs? This tape is perfect.I HAVVE LOST ALL DESIRE FOR FEELING https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2011/09/shoppers.html https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2010/10/nomad.html https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2012/02/grudges.html"

OK, maybe there are a LOT of those times, and maybe there's more output that sinks in that canyon than lands squarely on either side of it, BUT my point is that often I am not sure if I enjoy something because it's actually and objectively good (or even just interesting), or because I've been duped. I'm not the sharpest knife, and I'm pretty easy to get over on (especially when you're talking about something so completely outside of my typical wheelhouse), so maybe you throw a bunch of reverb on some ticking clocks and crumple paper next to a contact microphone and call it music and maybe I believe you. Or at least this is what I was thinking a few minutes into \"Lacking A Cast Shadow,\" the opening track of 2008's Graduating From Clocks To Watches. There's no rhyme rhythm or real reason, it's just a collection of sounds, and there's no art to that, right? There's no skill to that....right? But, I thought, what if I like it anyway? What if the innocent monotony of \"The Broken Windows Of A Fertile World\" actually seems kinda gorgeous, even if there's really nothing to it, and what if that is actually the point? What if that first song really was just ticking clocks and tearing paper and what if that was the message? I mean, surely this release falls into that aforementioned canyon somewhere, and maybe it never even makes its way out of the abyss, but listening to the chaotic crescendo that closes 13+ minutes of \"The Self Is An Onion-Self\" to end this release I once again decide that I don't care. And that I will listen again and not make judgements. That I will just absorb, and the result becomes the meaning itself.\u00a0 GRADUATING FROM CLOCKS TO WATCHES: EUREKA TAPES vol.II https://goateaterarts.bandcamp.com/"

The Cookie Moshter EP blew me away at the time, and they just seemed so bad ass (and high). I consulted Karoline on this and she said she was firmly in the L7 camp (\"Fast And Frightening\"?! she said, and suggested that LUNACHICKS always seemed less serious) and I confess that listening to this MLP recorded for a Japanese tour in the mid '90s makes me think that my wife is probably right. If there were no joke-y vocals then this band would be deadly, because when they are tough? LUNACHICKS will fucking crush you, and they swing (\"Curve Of Mother's Axe\") at all times. But it's hard to forgive the \"More Than A Feeling\" cover included here...but I'll keep cranking \"Light As A Feather, Stiff As A Board\" for the rest of the day anyway.

Disjointed ramblings and questionably tuned everything combine with a carpet bombing of various and sundry sounds and snappy, snotty, fukk you vocals. Tracks like \"Portrait Of The Artist As A Piece Of Shit\" certainly imply these New Orleans mutants are very very aware of what they are doing, and it doesn't make it any less appealing. I can't really picture a band consciously trying to manufacture a SOCKEYE vibe, but this one comes close and adds a stylish erratic swagger (I'm talking about the title track here).

Two doses of precision punk that learn from the lessons of the masters without plagiarizing, it's a truly perfect punk single and I cannot recommend it enough....but this blog is (still) about tapes, and ROTARY CLUB crammed some of their magic into a little red plastic shell last year and I just can not get enough of this shit. You're going to hear folks throw around the KBD tag a lot and I'm certainly not going to disagree even though it doesn't tell the whole story.

Only other time I saw them was with SUICIDE BOMB and a shitty Euro band...and that set also makes the list. Fast, snotty, hopelessly hook-filled punk...I like this the same way I like a few SCREECHING WEASEL tracks (except I don't have to hide my affinity for WHIZBANG). I like this the same fun b/w party way I like OiL!, but there are Reatard level chops and SPITS level wit in here too...it's that good. I like this the same way I even admit that RAMONES have some pretty essential tracks (I still contend they are over rated).

They lean more punk on a couple of tunes (\"Schwarzkommando,\" \"Hunting The Hunter\"), and the content makes it clear that WATCHER'S WOODS are coming from a clenched fist political angle even as they drench their drum machine and flangers in inward morosity and darkness. The closing anthem \"Kill Cops, Not Trees\" has a distinct but subdued Power, Corruption and Lies vibe and is the most optimistic sounding number...which seems somehow appropriate I suppose.

Tommy came to San Francisco a few times in the 90s, and immediately acquired a pretty enthusiastic fan base amongst our friends here. In 2002 on a tour of Brasil, imagine our excitement when we pulled up to a show and there was Tommy, waiting for us outside. Even better, he was living in Brasil, and his band was on tour, and they were hoping to jump onto the show that we were playing that night! Fast forward the story through weird club owners, uptight show promoter and add a smattering of scene politics being discussed in rapid fire Portuguese, and Tommy's band didn't share the stage with us that night. In fact, I don't even remember if they stayed for the show at all, his bandmates understandably soured by their treatment. Why do you care (if you care at all of course)? Tommy's band is 7 MAGNIFICOS, and the demo that he handed me when we parted ways 7 years ago (the last time I saw him) is the one that I am posting today. 7 MAGS are an anomaly in hardcore; they are genuinely original, and rarely, if ever, on this demo can I claim that they sound like anyone else at all. The songs are blended together brilliantly, and it really does feel like you've listened to one concise statement instead of 17 songs. How perfect are the stampeding elephants after the 4 second burst of \"Ren Ha Ga\"? These tracks appeared on a CD as well, with a \"better\" recording, but I almost never pull it out, this tape provides me with far too much joy to sour the experience with one of those round shiny things. I know this isn't from the UK, and even worse, it was recorded in the last 10 years, but 7 MAGS are fucking brilliant, and I hope you enjoy: Per I Qualche Dollaro Piu (Por Un Punhado De Dolares Mas) Also included in the download is their first recording session from 2000. There are 11 more tunes, and while they might not flow together quite as well as the \"Per I Qualche...\" demo, it's still a killer document of a brilliant band. //4.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/SoByI9ZC8oI/AAAAAAAAAHc/B2dFQp1ctVk/s1600-h/7Mags+cover.jpg"

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on September 28, 2010 Description from Terminal Escape: The title says it all, but this tape leaves me with as many questions as answers. Poland's SMIERC KLINICZNA released two relatively ripping singles on the Polish state Tonpress label in 1983 and 1984, but these tracks, recorded live from 1982-84 reveal a much more rock oriented side of the band. Songs like \"Kukurydza\" hint towards the trash that those EPs offered, but most of this tape focuses on killing psychedelic jams and creating party vibes...it almost makes me wonder if those two state label EPs were attempts to \"market\" the band to \"punks\" - perhaps I'm reading (or hearing) too much into these tracks, but the vibe I get is completely different from how I feel after spinning \"ASP\"\u00a0b/w\u00a0\"Jestem Ziarnkiem Piasku\" (which I did just now so I could confirm this vibe thing I'm experiencing at the moment).\u00a0\"Siekiera\" starts off as the rager on this tape (the song has nothing to do with the band of the same name), but it then digresses into a downtempo chill out with sporadic vocals reminiscent of southern neighbors F.P.B., and fits in nicely with the 'festival feel' set by most of this tape. At first listen, \"Nie Przedpraszaj\" and the prematurely cut off \"Homokracja\" might seem even further removed from the punk umbrella, but if it's raining, but I assure you that these songs do not mind staying dry underneath the protective punk shelter. \u00a0Call this one \"psych/punk meets hippie/rock meets total/art/weirdness under the Iron Curtain and records two live tapes over three years\" - enjoy if you dare, but an open mind and historical context might be required for full appreciation.

RED LORRY YELLOW LORRY is an under recognized band from these worlds, and it was a good initial introduction for me to acts like ONE MILLION BULGARIANS and AURORA (whose track is excellent dreary '80s with anguished vocals that seem like they would be more comfortable fronting a hardcore band). Great combination of underground standards and unknown bangers, and the level of quality is just as high as the later installment...I can only hope that the two volumes indicate a budding series?

Absolutely killer live band, and their recordings are all excellent. We need to be honest about the name for a moment though....and this is coming from a fellow who has been in more than two bands with questionable monikers...BAD DADDIES is a seriously flawed band name. I think that's the main reason that their run through most of the 2010s wasn't met with resounding praise, because the songs and delivery are superb. \"How Do You Like Your Coffee?\" is a straight classic, a song that could (and should) be on countless mix tapes throughout the next decade. The way they make bratty garage punk sound like art guitar driven college rock and/or vice versa...they just fucking nail it.

Wild and loose cacophonous punk from Minneapolis's ASS on one side (remnants of the overly prolific '00s will remember their pink\u00a0LP cover from the middle of that decade), like a Midwestern future FILTH (or that's what many of us thought at the time) ringing in that dupa-dupa 1-2-1-2 drum beat damn near a decade before it seemingly infected every corner of punk and hardcore. But to mix it up on the flip, ASS is paired up with COLON PIPE. Five bursts of tortured electronics on their side, defying construct or classification. Elements of techno creep in occasionally, and moments sound like primitive video game soundtracks (\"Azmile Quite Convinzing\" most particularly), both doomed to be overshadowed by overbearing synth blasts. Disjointed (almost) to the point of unlistenable at times, but that is most certainly the point. So I guess your week is gonna start out kinda weird, and you are welcome for that.\u00a0 ASS // COLON PIPE"

There were several cassette release in the mid-'10s, and I think that this self titled slammer from 2016 might be the best (Fuck Freek though...) - guitars are damaged, \"He Wants A Baby\" comes in like a bullet from another time, everything is just completely dialed on this one, and I firmly believe that it should be heralded as a modern classic.

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on April 09, 2015 Description from Terminal Escape: I like stories, and tour stories are especially appealing. I like hearing them, and I love telling them. Understandably, stories evolve over time...as our memories become more memories of the story and less memories of the actual incidents, embellishments and distortions are inevitable. But that's a part of it, and a part of what makes a good story. I can't tell you how many times I've heard a story and thought \"I don't want to know if that's true or not, because it's a great story.\" We aren't news reporters and we aren't writing critical historical accounts, we are passing legends within our own small society, and that's what history is.\u00a0I'm not supporting factual inaccuracies, but we need to acknowledge that an acceptable amount of distortion, revision and adaptation is to be expected in the interest of a good story. Enter: Shitbong. This is the way I remember a certain show on the FUCKFACE/HICKEY tour in 1996.... We rolled up to a house in Grand Rapids, Michigan. A young gentleman named Jizz greeted us at the door and showed us around the place we would be playing and staying...it was cold as shit, and the oldest person in the house seemed to be 15 years old at best. These kids were young, like \"where are their parents\" young, and had us all wondering if there were would be \"adults\" present. Not that I'm opposed to a 15 year old getting wild and partying (quite the opposite), but my grown up California ass in a house full of plastered runaways is a tough thing to explain to the cops that are inevitably going to come bust the show...these are things you think about in a free society, I suppose. Jizz introduced us to the kids, showed us to the basement that was barely big enough for our gear and only left space on the stairs for anyone to watch the band (should they even decide to pry themselves away from the party long enough to try....which seemed unlikely). After the basement, we saw a lethargic young man sitting on the couch, hovering over a giant pile of weed on the coffee table. Jizz introduced the guy as Shitbong. \"Don't call me Shitbong man, that's not my name. My name's Mike,\" was Shitbong's reply. Jizz laughed, \"Whatever, Shitbong.\" The show was fun, it never got warmer, kids did indeed crowd the stairs while our bands played, and I have no idea if we slept there or not. I'm sure Shitbong's given name has changed countless times as I've recounted the story over the years, but \"Don't call me Shitbong, that's not my name\" has been enough of a constant that it's crossed over into \"don't care if it's true or not\" territory. I ran into Jizz a few times in Milwaukee, years after our initial meeting he was working in a tire shop and was always filthy with adult work scum instead of youthful party scum. He left town shortly after I arrived...and I eventually met (and worked with) a woman who knew Jizz in Grand Rapids and confirmed my memories of the punk house as a repository for wayward youth. Then I got this LARVAE demo from my pal Daniel a few months ago. Grand Rapids catchy hardcore circa 1995, anti-government, hell bent on partying, and unhinged as fukk. But more importantly: Shitbong was real!! \u00a0If only I remembered meeting Spitter or Penis Dan - and I'm sure they were there - the story could be so much better.\u00a0 LARVAE //3.bp.blogspot.com/-Z_HhdganJak/VSarZ4jmoyI/AAAAAAAAMJQ/OHhxjeYLXtk/s1600/larvae%2Bcover.jpg //2.bp.blogspot.com/-3yaMZHiJ4dY/VSawPFgs_kI/AAAAAAAAMJg/QJrYP9KYJDU/s1600/larvae%2Bimg2.jpg //4.bp.blogspot.com/-FWEA_qRlIfY/VSayCV3I-HI/AAAAAAAAMJ0/jM5fOltvLFI/s1600/larvae%2Bimg.jpg //4.bp.blogspot.com/--V_kMlrc8oo/VSax8pFaYTI/AAAAAAAAMJs/BoL-erHezLE/s1600/larvae%2Binside.jpg"

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on November 29, 2013 Description from Terminal Escape: Only one vinyl release from this late '80s Bay Area outfit (I think the EP came out in 1990?), which is perhaps why they are so often overlooked, but both demos are in today's download so you can spend your day playing catchup. Fast melodic punk with guitars ripped out of a searing hardcore outfit and melancholic vocals that lament as much as they sing. A Disappointment sounds hesitant and awkward, aside from the guitars, and the result is endearing from the very first note. Lost is certainly a stronger and more mature release, the guitars are reigned in to focus on melody, the vocals are more confident and lilting, and the songs are more dynamic - hard to say which I like better though (part of the reason I just threw 'em both up here). This music comes from before my time in the Bay Area, but I can imagine that if there had been any connection whatsoever between FILTH and JAWBREAKER (I don't think that there was) then it would have sounded like this.\u00a0 A DISAPPOINTMENT // LOST //1.bp.blogspot.com/-2Ur0W5XLzkk/UpjMBy9Z7uI/AAAAAAAAJFk/1V3frA9m2ac/s1600/vagrants+-+disappointment+cover+copy.jpg //1.bp.blogspot.com/-EYTedOKcrNo/UpjN70ME0nI/AAAAAAAAJFw/VfmgDPB8lyg/s1600/vagrants+-+disappointment+img+copy.jpg //2.bp.blogspot.com/-rEd5Eh0DqH8/UpjOCFK-IkI/AAAAAAAAJF4/4XFwGrqR7YI/s1600/vagrants+-+lost+cover+copy.jpg //2.bp.blogspot.com/-f_EZT9nh97A/UpjOP7DKd6I/AAAAAAAAJGI/6QzOCoPySSQ/s1600/vagrants+-+lost+img2+copy.jpg"

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on April 19, 2014 Description from Terminal Escape: There was a period in that late '90s/early '00s when genre divisions in San Francisco were blurred, especially within the subsects of bands loosely considered \"hardcore,\" and it was nice. On initial listen, TIME IN MALTA are polished, emotional and sound very clean (as in clean music made by clean people for other clean hardcore fans). Todd's vocals are always at their breaking point, but are still controlled, and the songs them selves are a picture of managed discordance with more than ample opportunity for boys to mosh. So yeah, sounds like a band that might have been fine, but one that probably existed in another realm. But, perhaps because they didn't exactly have a realm of their own and perhaps just because they were down ass dudes, TIME IN MALTA spent much of that era playing the Tip Top, Covered Wagon and Mission Records, they played with TRAGEDY on their first trip down the coast, and shared the stage with ARTIMUS PYLE often enough that we jokingly dubbed ourselves the SF Passion Metal Mafia (a split EP was discussed and 625 offered to release it, something I still wish had we had done, if only because that combination of forces would have been even weirder in retrospect than it seemed at the time). Their live shows were always incredible, the embodiment of a band who always left everything on the \"stage\" (or floor), and even if it wasn't your \"thing\" it was hard to deny their power. These two songs are from the Construct and Demolish 12\" on Escape Artist, a record that holds up shockingly well to my ears. There were two full lengths that followed on Equal Vision, and they definitely found their realm in the world of club hardcore. While the later records aren't really to my liking, the band always crushed it live, and it baffles me that, even (or especially) in the context of that world, their releases are relegated to discount dins.\u00a0 SWALLOWING GLASS // MOMENT OF CLARITY //2.bp.blogspot.com/-pU-rMBlpvPE/U1KrIm8fpbI/AAAAAAAAJ4k/IY11PFchYWc/s1600/time+in+malta+cover.jpg //4.bp.blogspot.com/-XKJ6DDPbEgQ/U1Kxdm8AHpI/AAAAAAAAJ40/OP2h9taeY50/s1600/time+in+malta+spine.jpg"

Simplicity is the key, with sharp vocals barked over Blinko blunt song construction with (still) that Greg Sage vibe that Francis just can't shake (and we're glad).

I have made no secret of my affinity for noise presented as hardcore, and New York's LIMBS BIN are a perfect example...there is no music, but these blasts of electronics are constructed like short bursts from a primitive grind band, and I imagine the live delivery being similarly intense. These recordings are from a 2012 trip to Israel - one show at an anarchist collective, one in the basement of a bagel shop, and a super heavy field recording from Bil'in, Palestine (heavy, perhaps, because it all sounds so normal). The motivation and presentation of these recordings is both pure and apparent, something that might not come across from simply listening to disjointed sonic eruptions, even the simplest act can be political....and even the smallest gesture can be important. More tracks from the same tour can be found here, along with recordings of Israeli bands that played with LIMBS BIN on their tour....do this, my friends. Do it now.

There's more in ZAVAR than lives in the internet, however, at least it appears that way, and several unnamed tracks are presented as mere numbers. Like a catalog of aural mania or some shit.

This one was easy to skip over...weird bedroom digital logo with a high school notebook drawing of a rat crawling out of the world, initially hard to tell who the band is or where they're from. But after passing it over amidst gems on the \"I need to listen to these\" shelves, I popped ABERGAZ in a few weeks ago. With more than a dozen releases (so far) in their decade and counting long existence, it's no surprise that these Croatians have their approach dialed in and on point. Perhaps a touch too slick for some Escape visitors, I find these tracks ultra addictive. Fast and tight, the approach hits me like RATOS DE POR\u00c3O clashing with catchy Eastern European punk...there's a slight enjoyment curve to be sure, but it's worth whatever it takes to get over and/or around whatever might be in your way. Now....I'm going to spend my Sunday listening to all of the tapes with bad covers that I keep putting off until another day, and then I'm going to listen to more ABERGAZ.

The guitars are positively screaming throughout with discordant leads soaring over the top, but the vocals are the focal point of the recording. High end impassioned screams that remind me more than a little bit of Mariam (PERMANENT RUIN, CONDENADA) are backed sporadically with low crust growls, but those lead vocals will pierce you and hold you like a vice.

Now, I am well aware that this doesn't make sense (at all), but I'm still sticking by it, even (especially) when the band drops into CAVE IN style meanderings on \"\u041c\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0437\u0430,\" a sub-60 second interlude that could serve as an introduction to the following track, the midtempo \"\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0437\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\" that is probably the highlight of the entire demo.

So I probably waitied longer than I should have to dive into this tape (I mean, what if it was a stinker and I ran into my pal in public and they asked my opinion.....? hashtag: awkward), but even on my most enthusiastic day I could never have imagined that MORDANT would be this incredible. Eschewing virtually every modern hardcore trapping imaginable, they channel mid '90s chaotic emotional hardcore flawlessly...and my jaw is on the floor. Because they don't just embody the sounds (which they do really well, by they way); the tension is there, the intensity is there...they just fukkn nail it. Mostly high end vocals try so hard to give up but they keep getting pushed ever further, scattered and manic structures that are ruled by constantly meandering bass lines and a guitar assault that holds nothing back. Guitar/vocal combo in \"Ruined Machine\" reminds me of MILEMARKER, the subtle bass octave drop in \"Justines Of The World: Unite\" is indescribably perfect....and the whole fukkn thing reminds me of ONE EYED GOD PROPHECY. Do you have any idea how many times I have thought or said that I wanted bands to start trying to sound like ONE EYED GOD PROPHECY instead of primitive knuckle dragging hardcore? A lot of times....so many times. So yeah....thanks, MORDANT.

They've painted a sonic picture of a beach culture born under a full desert moon in the blinding heat of summer, teletransported to abandoned city spaces devoid of toxic humanity. Also, it's wild how much surf guitar dominated DEAD KENNEDYS sound but we were too young to know it at the time (unrelated observation). \"Desert Masks\" is a truly transcendent and/or indulgent banger (related observation).\u00a0 M\u00c1SCARAS vs. M\u00c1SCARAS https://mascaras.bandcamp.com/merch"

But ages later, I can't tell you how psyched I am to unearth this cassette - terminally catchy and shamelessly dark punk tunes, this is just awesome.

Their somewhat second tier status is likely a product of a few years and scene fluctuations more than a reflection on their recordings - image these tracks had come out in 1983 with a slightly less metal guitar tone, and I think you'd have an entirely different legacy. DAN were serious, but DAN seems fun.

Minneapolis' CONDOMINIUM were a hardcore band way ahead of the curve when this demo dropped in 2008 - simple and rambunctious with classic USHC vocals and riffs galore. There were two 45s that followed this demo and set the groundwork for a band that has sporadically cranked out some incredibly good records. Four songs here, rawer and more driving than most of their vinyl output, but no less compelling - from a great hardcore demo to a really great guitar driven band. It's music that you understand, but you keep listening because it's good and because it sounds new. Accolades of the highest order.

The four new tracks from the EP are the realization of the sound that their tape releases have hinted at - manic vocals howled in desperation over desperate and distorted hardcore. They do it right, and they do so with determination - 20 tracks here in total - enough to get you completely up to date.

Not much to say that I didn't say nine years ago, just furiously fast and incredibly furious hardcore punk. \"No Lifeboats\" and \"Fate\" could have been anthems for the isolation age that kicked off this portentous decade dominated by fear and frustration, while \"I Wish I Could Help You\" closes the tape with a positively dreadful (and positively negative) dose of loss. I know it's 'hardcore' and hardcore can be a somewhat limited medium, but DEMANDS sound like they are manifesting pain. There are only two tapes - a scant twenty minutes of music - but the shit is just furious.

We wanted to play another gig, to be sure, but my main motivation for hauling ass was to see this Colombian band in the flesh. DEAD HERO's brand of Oi! is so simple...and it's so right. Every track is an anthem, every guitar lead is perfectly flanged and on fukkn point, every chorus makes you want to put a fist in the air....and I wanted my fist in the air. The drive was long and I kinda didn't think we were gonna make it, but when Jordan replied to my inquiry and let me that while we were 20 miles out, DEAD HERO were just setting up, I leaned my foot in a little harder.....the plan was working. And the overnight was more than worth it for the 20 minutes of punk that we saw in the park. It was everything it was supposed to be - perfectly crafted tracks that could inspire the most jaded. Saw them and their tourmates FINAL two days later in SF to a mostly empty full El Rio while the cool kids chilled at the JJ DOLL gig up the block (worthwhile gig mind you, JJ DOLL killed it...but \u00a0DEAD HERO started after they were finished, and what fool doesn't walk a block to see a Colombian punk band? Most of San Francisco, apparently...), and they were, not surprisingly, even better than at the outside gig in the park. Fukkn flawless, in fact. These tracks are going to get into you, my friends...and California denizens have two more days to catch them on tour (if I wasn't playing a show tonight then I would hitch a ride to Sacramento my own damn self).

And when I returned home from a month traversing some of the lesser visited corners of the Great North American West with Karoline, my reward was waiting for me. I think I told the moderator that I liked \"blackened crust\" or something like that, but whatever I said totally worked because the tape I received is a perfect combination of filthy bangers that I already know (or own) and stuff that was new to me. If I were being overly critical, I would say that you don't really need to put HHIG on a tape curated for a group of nerds who are clearly already fans of the genre, but my mix tape style runs a little more off the beaten path, and cranking \"Internally Bleeding\" will always remind me of the first time I heard the track at volume just after passing the westbound toll gate on the Bay Bridge into SF 20something years ago. ATRAMENT, TEMPEST, HEXIS, SKITSYSYSTYEM, AGRIMONIA, NEGATIVE STANDARDS, MISANTHROPIC make up most of the first side, SYMPTOM, WORMWOOM, VORDE, UNRU, B\u00d6LZER, BOTANIST, BUIOINGOLA on the flip. Listening highlights were remembering how much I like UNRU, the stupid fast eurocrust B\u00dcTRON, and the ALUK TODOLO material that wraps up the first side.

Late '80s Hungarian punk with elements of UK anarcho and mind melting psychedelia wrapped inside their unique approach to songwriting. While the \"official\" demos I've shared before are excellent, I think I prefer this session that came to me with nothing but song titles and a band name on the spine...TROTTEL were playing outside of the lines before the lines were even drawn.

This ten song deposit is the aural equivalent of being punched in the face repeatedly by a plastic bag full of poop - a bag that just will not break. Filthy downtuned guitars that should be bashing out third rate stoner riffs are instead delivering off the rails mutant hardcore, and it makes everything sound even weirder. The vocals struggle to keep up, and I picture a singer who spends more time losing his mind on stage than actually singing. It's \"Ink\u00e1bb Otthon\" where things really click - that awkward repetitive riff playing host to samples of live hardcore banter for nearly two minutes....and you realize that NORMS are actual geniuses. True freak hardcore in the finest sense of the term - like INFEST and ACRYLICS together, but as teenagers. \"Mened\u00e9k\" is the choice banger, and has the slammingest intro that the cool kids and the hyped bands try so hard to write.

Abrasive, fast and raspy melodic hardcore, SECTION 46 come off like a modern incarnation of FUNERAL ORATION mixed with melodic 90s punk (HICKEY keeps coming to mind, though that could be something about the approach rather than the tunes themselves, early SHOTWELL might be a better musical comparison, but way faster). The pace is frantic, the vocals are blown out but still worthy of the off key back ups (which are awesome even if not actually good...). I gather that they were contemporaries of RENDER USELESS and other Victoria bands I already like, and have seen their name mentioned in discussions about first and/or influential punk and hardcore gigs.\u00a0Unfortunately, my copy of The Downtrodden\u00a0(with While Injustice Continues\u00a0on the flipside for a future post) comes with no song titles, so these 22 songs are simply named by number.

THE WINGNUTS don't sound like THE DILS. Instead, the trio delivers infectious, dark, almost-indie punk (before 'indie punk' as its own thing was a....thing). The guitars have a nice Joe Jack Talcum twang, and the vocals are just awkward enough, there's an occasional underlying surf vibe...but the songs are the thing, because the songs are great. And weird. They don't just not sound like THE DILS, they don't really sound like anything except THE WINGNUTS - a 1990s band from the Bay Area.\u00a0THE WINGNUTS https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjdEQc3RaS9Z5wIPTg5nlKbKnPHEgwarnJ8k86tKhSpQfk_Pi3nON9xNJpmVbvXadxw6FaR6bTlnIVhUc9_15lpoM7pq9-wsE71N1dVX1qdTT1IJa-4fbPWUUkKaUmjnsGE5Ktoq2t1etyJj-4_Tp9_PqJYWqXk6RFOf-7lfWwx7Y3VTsENf3fkcr7Ccg=s811 https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjjD7GPwGC21qsW7edH_3BGiBurQLvxhOt7p51QPk8ZK0cnbpZWs01ZS2Nf9dbrjJJi_veu5Vn9cPPJ0b54jdF0UNLkJ0EUXTq5wsLYrzqeWoZIRJKLEiKpKpIOcmPMg8UFUh3wktIw2-4rkP8gbRVe01x_O6ht-VvANwqfAAjJYSnr8Jz4nAp5WpbuEQ=s785"

The guitar is screaming, a buzzsaw on top of a furious drum attack that is a little more unhinged on this recording than on their LP (which is mandatory listening in my opinion). And while the vocals that \"Nurse\" belts out might be a little bouncy, there is an attitude and a ferocity that no melody can hide. \"White Skin,\" standout track, and \"Chronic\" sounds like the hardcore song that X never wrote.

Listen to the swell of electronics that takes up the first 5 minutes of \"Grave Mistake,\" and then realize that this swell is, in fact, the track itself rather than an introduction to aural violence. It's a tension that is so calm that's it's difficult to put into words.

Hard to put this one in a box, which is exactly what you get when you pile up a bunch of young punks with slightly different ideas of what they want to be....sometimes that combination falls flat on its pimply face, but these kids are on point and getting better.\u00a0 MOTHER WAS A BABY // FUCK FREEK Not coincidentally, NO STATIK is playing Santa Rosa tonight with LIVING EYES, SKIN LIKE IRON, WALLFLOWER and SPELLS. Then next Friday we share a house in Long Beach with ACRYLICS, RATS IN THE WALL, FRAUDE and GENERACION SUICIDA.

In a world where gratuitous samples and songs about professional wrestling stood as equals alongside punishingly heavy hardcore - what was then the transformation of '90s political crust - there are few bands that stand the test of time. Sometimes, those bands are certified classics, and sometimes those bands are new discoveries like STAMANECH 6.40. Pissed as fukk but with an undeniable sense of levity, this shit is exactly what I need. I hope it is also exactly what my friends in Australia need after their apparent return to reactionary rule. Any time your newly elected prime minister declares that your country is \"open for business,\" you should be very afraid...but the industrial remix of \"Sabu\" contained herein should serve as an escape and as a survivor of The Bush Years (all 12 of them) I can assure you that escapes are necessary.

The pace is insane, the riffs are relentless, and the drums will have you scraping your jaw off the floor. Check the fills in \"Rigged\" - they take a screaming (but simple) two riff/one bridge DBeat song and turn it into an absolute monster.

And when I returned home from a month traversing some of the lesser visited corners of the Great North American West with Karoline, my reward was waiting for me. I think I told the moderator that I liked \"blackened crust\" or something like that, but whatever I said totally worked because the tape I received is a perfect combination of filthy bangers that I already know (or own) and stuff that was new to me. If I were being overly critical, I would say that you don't really need to put HHIG on a tape curated for a group of nerds who are clearly already fans of the genre, but my mix tape style runs a little more off the beaten path, and cranking \"Internally Bleeding\" will always remind me of the first time I heard the track at volume just after passing the westbound toll gate on the Bay Bridge into SF 20something years ago. ATRAMENT, TEMPEST, HEXIS, SKITSYSYSTYEM, AGRIMONIA, NEGATIVE STANDARDS, MISANTHROPIC make up most of the first side, SYMPTOM, WORMWOOM, VORDE, UNRU, B\u00d6LZER, BOTANIST, BUIOINGOLA on the flip. Listening highlights were remembering how much I like UNRU, the stupid fast eurocrust B\u00dcTRON, and the ALUK TODOLO material that wraps up the first side.

It was a good reminder that sometimes you need to get away to simply get real - and when I was done taking my picture next to a teenager duct taped to a barstool in the kitchen, I watched CRIMINAL WAVE rock the shit out of that sweaty ass hole in the ground and the kids that weren't drinking and playing video games in the living room showed their appreciation enthusiastically.

Ten tracks, and the whole thing fukkn cooks...even through a less than optimal demo quality recording. But everything is here, and tracks like \"Ruled By The State\" show the chops and vision of a band that deserves more than some grey bearded boner blabbing about them on the internet twenty years in the future.

I think Punk passed some kind of legislation banning vaguely funky melodic skate punk with vocal harmonies after a few Warped Tours when they (Punks) realized that the people who listened to (and, more importantly: created) this music were actually just the then-present-day versions of the people who had spent the '80s kicking our asses and bullying us into quiet depression and a collective solitude. But no....definitely 1999, and still I like it. I'm picturing us rolling through Nebraska in '95 on one of the FUCKFACE tours blasting this on the tinny Econoline 6\" speakers and talking about going everywhere. MOODFYRE sound adolescent, they sound hopeful, but mostly they just sound real. And if that's how you deliver your vocal melodies and your vaguely Fat guitar licks?

I GIVE UP perfectly capture the determined churn, the discordant guitars, the lurching tempos, the general cacophony and the vocals....three dudes just spewing their guts and you know they mean it. I like when you can just tell, when it sounds desperate, when it sounds like they are just about to....well, just about to give up. The samples and bits between tracks (mostly culled from banter off of rehearsal tapes) are a touch goofy at times, but they add a welcome touch of unpredictability to a demo that already sounds like nothing else. I only saw the band once, and I remember them sticking out and confusing people...I'm guessing that happened a lot.

Superb guitars that swerve between ADOLESCENTS and DEAD KENNEDYS, snarky vocals and classic California attitude...all of the ingredients are here, and aside from a couple of duds (\"Man's Best Friend\" and \"Up To You\" are just unnecessary musically, even though the latter is excellent lyrically) the result is stellar. \"Superpowers\" is the standout (either because of or in spite of the meandering guitar led breakdown that makes up the last third of the track) and tracks like \"No Reason To Live\" are certified creamers.

Four Filipino immigrants living and working here, surrounded and influenced by their community and shaped by the distance between them and their families, they take honest hardcore intensity to a new level. While whatever flavor of the month band is singing about abstract death and/or despair or perhaps the perils of wars that they will never know, ANINOKO speak bluntly about the problems associated with donating money to mainstream aid organizations and class separations in Philippines permeating every aspect of society (the first track on this demo, \"Aircon\" addresses this in the context of something as simple as air conditioning). They talk about the social struggle of the immigrant communities they are a part of, and they sing about the reality of raising families while being separated from their families. And if you don't want to get heavy....? That's cool, because they also rip. They translate well on studio recordings, but (as with most, if not all, good hardcore) they are best experienced live....which I will be doing this evening at El Rio in San Francisco.\u00a0 AIRCON https://aninoko.bandcamp.com/ https://www.facebook.com/events/523081231408464/?active_tab=discussion"

Detroit's SCRUFFY TEARAWAYS open the comp with two sinister crossover rippers and THE VACANT follow up with shrill UK influenced punk, good enough that you stick around for TATTOOED CORPSE and VOODOO LOVE GODS dropping by with their distinct brands of sleazy bar punk. Primitive crossover from BLINDED DESTINY, roughshod melodic punk from THIRSTY, then GRIEVANCE COMMITTEE, ZOMBIE TERRORISTS, X WOOLHEAD, COMMONWEALTH and A.D. plow through the second side before SHARK FETISH bash out a harmonica drenched garage hardcore stomp to close the tape.

The Nuggets meets boogie rock swagger of RAD CLOUD steal the tape for me, a uniquely casual and laid back approach to what are basically tried and true formulas (and the vocals are the closest I've heard to T.REX's \"Spaceball Ricochet\" in forever, which puts this track way over the top). FANTASTIC FIGURES, APOGEE SOUND CLUB and DAIKON contribute tracks as well, while C'EST DOMMAGE and THE C'MEL provide completely different interpretations of the same song to bookend this short tape. The majority of these sounds fall well outside my typical scope of interest, but the level of quality is high (I dare say even higher than expected), and it's good to look around the corner every now and then....you never know what might be sitting on the sidewalk.

FUNCTIONAL IDIOTS should have started in 1984 (they would have been faster and weirder, which would have been better), AS ONE sound like a raw '80s 'crew outfit in a really positive way, and A.W.O.L. sound like a melodic blur (also in a positive way, and their bass player rips). Epic crossover from POOR EXCUSE and stripped bar punk from AFFIRMATIVE ACTION round out the collection, and you don't need to thank me for the tape warps...I only deliver the goods in the shape in which they were given to me.

Those two nudges helped put a lot of pieces together....Windham Hill is not (and never was) the devil they just released a lot of really shit records (just like most punk labels). Maybe these sounds aren't meant to lull you, maybe they are meant to open you. Listening to Pat Wright's DJ sets flow from NEGATIVE FX to THE FALCONS and then some spaced out hippie synths right into FALSE PROPHETS really helped drive the whole thing home - that it wasn't all the same, but it could all hit the same way.

Seven UK rippers and a poem about killers, all delivered with dubious fidelity. Pleading For Peace is clearly the product of a fan - the cover is colored in by hand and I'm sure they were dubbed one at a time, hopefully in a teenager's bedroom. LAST RITES and BROKEN BONES each offer four snappy UK82 bangers, live versions of SUBHUMANS' \"Pisshead\" and \"Apathy\" from a raucous set previously available on an earlier Bluurg release. The mercurial (and prolific) anarcho solo project STATEMENT makes an appearance, and the tape rounds out with MUTED EXISTENCE, THE DISTURBED and AWOL (speaking of low fidelity - yeesh!). The AWOL tracks are perhaps the most interesting - one of the members ran Bloody Monkers Tapes and three of their songs are unlistenable to all but the most curious, top notch mid-paced UK punk buried in 40p cheap cassette bliss, but then the studio cut \"Someone In Control\" throws off the blanket of hiss to expose a should-be-classic-but-totally-unknown banger that inspired me to go back and check \"Died In Action\" and yearn for a clean versions of all of their material (also inspired me to drop a postcard in the mail to the label address because...well, I like a nice fruitless adventure). An hour of sound curated nearly 40 years ago, hopefully by an eager teenager who used their creation to network with other enthusiastic and disenfranchised kids. Quality definitely suffers generally (and particularly with the aforementioned replication fidelity for AWOL and some tape speed issues during a couple of LAST RITES tunes), but it settles in pretty nicely and takes you back to a completely different time - a new dawn in a small company town in southern England.\u00a0 PLEADING FOR PEACE"

Buzzsaw guitars, vocals that personify teen angst from the land of the Valley Girl....and in the time of Valley Girl, the angst is not hard to imagine.

To us left coasters, the early '10s were awash with nuke york and toxic states and an avalanche of bands whose sound and aura kicked DIY punk in the fukkn teeth. A lot of that shit had (has) some real staying and some of those bands and labels truly left a mark....now that the dust has settled, the new has worn off and those kids who upset the system are now institutions, you can see some of those marks, even if they are faint. But what of GREY NURSE? Was NYC fucking with their interesting, passionate DIY hardcore in their world filled with fashion, cocaine and misanthropy? Maybe they were, but on this left coast I had no idea....until now. You can hear where they are coming from, but the great ones can put something familiar in front of you and still leave you floored, which is what their sole release does to me. Take the second track \"Born Into This\" as a prime example - in just 80 seconds GREY NURSE encapsulate all of the sonic protein that I need in my musical diet, and every second tastes delicious. The foundation is early '00s hardcore, leaning as much on the emotional tinges as the blasts and breakdowns - take the quiet middle section of \"Excuses\" or the gentle landing in \"Born Into This\" as evidence that, quite simply, these cats knew exactly what they were doing. The vocals on \"Asleep.\" The nod to Kirsch with the guitars that open \"Stolen Language.\" The sheer intensity of the closer \"Old.\" Each subsequent listen reveals more moments...and that's an indicator that the recording you're listening to is, in fact, truly great. So maybe GREY NURSE weren't with the in-crowd at the time, or maybe they just were just a blip and didn't have time to jump in the water...I'm not here to analyze sub-scenes or do a post mortem on trends that dominated past decades, today I'm just here to suggest that you listen to this GREY NURSE tape, because it's really good and it sounds like they really fucking meant it.\u00a0GREY NURSE"

There's way more to the artist, who's been active for dozens of years, but evaluating and cataloging the recording on its merits alone might help the listener to have a more honest encounter with the sounds.

There's a killer three band split with DAYLIGHT ROBBERY and DEFECT DEFECT and I kinda feel like that a perfect place to squeeze this band in, though the distinctive vocals are such a huge focal point that it's really hard to try to put them in a box with any other band/s.

This is raw as shit, but the songs captured on this tape are manic with brilliant guitars buried in the swarm of accidental lo-fi hiss. Think ACME (Japan, one of the earliest Escape posts) for a reference, but these sounds are exponentially less produced even though they are every bit as advanced. If you want non stop studded mania then this is not your lucky day...if you want noisy interesting punk then you are in luck. Curiously, the final track is a proper studio recording that indicates the direction this band would take if given the opportunity and/or budget. \u00a0More introspective than the rest of the tracks, but I dare day more interesting...I know I have a lot of words, but this tape is both a mystery and a challenge, so prepare yourself.

Female lead vocals strain to be heard (and I mean that in terms of volume and intent) while the rest of the unit blazes through eight songs in just over ten minutes. Choice jam is \"Last Words,\" an absolute ripper than clocks in at 0:41 and perfectly executes blasting hardcore intensity, a perfect bridge between HANGMAN's ever so slightly introspective approach and just setting everything on \"rage,\" which they also do very well on tracks like \"Eviction\" and \"40 Hour Death Sentence.\" I've never heard anything else from the band, and even though this demo is 13 years old it's going to be kicking my ass all day.

Years back, there was APHASIA (who later morphed into DIE SCREAMING), who were good, but always seemed to me like they were almost able to combine their differing influences and ideas and turn themselves into a truly great punk band. Well, after the demise of DIE SCREAMING, 1/2 of the band started ICON GALLERY, and let there be no doubt that tremendous success has been achieved! This is their first recording from 2007, and these four songs manage to put together one of the most unique vocalists I've ever heard with a complete powerhouse on guitar, and the result is simply fucking beautiful. The guitar is the focal point for me (I'm perhaps in the minority here, Chani's vocals are out of this world and impossible to ignore, but the guitars are so fucking great), classic '80s US Midwest hardcore style riffing (think HUSKER DU, ARTICLES OF FAITH, but completely original) and leads that come out of nowhere and then fade seamlessly back into the song. ICON GALLERY has released two vinyl slabs (one of which is this cassette demo) that both made my top 10 releases last year...I'm just thankful that this one was a tape first, so I get to share it here.

Spastic thrash fanatics ripping blast beats and bong hits before either were in vogue, dropping funky break downs and Zappa song construction into face melting Bay Area thrash. OK, weed was never out of vogue. \"Prostitution,\" the opening track on their self titled 1988 demo, has more riffs and changes than most entire records...you exhale when the song ends and only then do you realize that you've been holding your breath for more than three minutes. There's the self titled demo from 1991 too (with the same cover art and two of the same tracks), a brighter session that helps them fall more in sonic line with the West Bay Coalition crew they are often associated with - an association solidified when 625 Productions slapped the '91 demo on wax later in the decade. The instrumental \"The Pot Song\" (which appears on both demos) probably captures MORBID LIFE SOCIETY best - a prog/funk/thrash instrumental that has no business on a normal punk or metal record until they break loose with an insane dose of blast for the last 30 seconds. Maybe MLS fit in everywhere because they didn't fit in anywhere, but listening to these kids bash the shit out of their very existence and just let it all loose is like filling your lungs with history.\u00a0There are (confirmed) reports that 625 is planning to drop both of these demos onto a cassette for modern consumption, maybe the other 1988 demo too, so those of us who (justifiably) feel like there is nothing to look forward to...there's hope.\u00a0DEMO 88\u00a0 DEMO 91 https://625thrash.bandcamp.com/ https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2014/07/morbid-life-society.html"

Sometimes. Luckily, I got a second chance in San Francisco last weekend, and as I stepped into that basement, the wall of sound blew me the fukk over...the kids were right. Maximum intensity blown out raw DBeat punk of the highest order with riff presentation and song construction head and shoulders above the crowd. ETERAZ inject the mid tempo metallic DISCHARGE chug (hereto referred to as \"dischug\") into unhinged lightning fast DBeat seamlessly, and I don't mean like \"fast part/slow part\" (because anyone can do that), it's like they are doing it at the same damn time. The show was sweaty and loud, and the band was fukkn good...the tape gives you a chance to listen and dissect though - and there's a LOT to dissect - so this might be a rare instance where I prefer the recorded manifestation.

This tape, my friends, this tape is the sound of your failure. Congratulations.\u00a0MIDWEST DEDICATION"

After we started off in Clovis, New Mexico, we set off for Albuquerque to play with the closest thing to a \"known\" band we would share a show with during our two week, seven show adventure: NAKED AGGRESSION. But we showed up to find that our LA via Wisconsin pals had broken down, and that a band from El Paso was giving them a ride to the show...and that's how we met NOT SO HAPPY. Scruffy, fast and crazy catchy, they blew the other bands off the stage (and yeah, that included New Mexico's infamous WADS) then zipped off into the desert, carting a helpless NAKED AGGRESSION back to their busted ass van. Dudes from this band would spend the rest of the '90s in other underappreciated bands like CHINESE LOVE BEADS and LOS VAGINAL BLOOD FARTS (the latter did a split with HICKEY, though I think they were just called VBF by then).

NEGATIVE GEMINI release is that it's distant and....not just untouchable, but unattainable. Because it's not for you. These four songs sound wonderful this morning, there are moments that might even make you feel good (at least in a moment) and these sounds are there for you to appreciate. But you can never have them - and you can feel that distance when you listen. I could discuss the ominous dance floor sensuality of \"Ghost World\" and the repetitive \"All I Ever Wanted Was To Feel Again...\" plea that swims through the beats, but those beats have been analyzed since they appeared on Forget Your Future in 2013 (with versions of the other three songs contained here) so I'll just let you...listen. And maybe that line in \u201cGhost World\u201d is actually \u201cAll I Ever Wanted Was To Feel OK\u201d or maybe it\u2019s both.

I knew them, I knew their other projects (THE BLUES, STILLSUIT, MOZART, PIG DNA), and I knew NEON from its inception. But it was a weird time and I never saw their chaos in person. There weren't very many shows, to be fair, but that shouldn't be an excuse. It's a reason...but it's not an excuse. What did I miss? No rules, sonic dissonance, art smashing full speed into punk norms and destroying sonic and visual expectations. Sometimes Rosie's bass is quite literally the only thing holding the band together (we're talking about PIG DNA drums and STILLSUIT guitar here, remember), and the vocals are could be an abrasive noise and/or no wave project on their own. And it happened while the Bay Area was in transition, while the members were in transition, while I was in transition, and while I listen this morning it's as if NEON represents so many of those changes (to me), even though I never saw them live (the 12\" release show at The Hive is a thing of legend) and didn't even have a copy of this tape until recently. Even when things change, I guess you've still got some time to catch yourself up - and even without the context, NEON gonna take you on a wild ass ride this morning.\u00a0NEON https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2017/07/the-blues.html https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2014/07/stillsuit.html https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2016/01/mozart.html https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2015/06/pig-dna.html https://neonislife.bandcamp.com/ https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWpMbM2E_8GFnCyxYRR594gJwbBpmM5LaMtlmXM_ZUyDeI5s-y6xlnlOaeu362Qik3jUdsyhw0s9IklOSoF5AFH7LYlJSVzzE_vPhEN_37qCZJ_iI7v_EVLBnAiw0uFoo_SJ65pT6xlIzV0QToOEsI6QdFxxxU36Gvwx3kq8usY_97GWbsf1TLkYiQ0A/s195/Neon%20TE%20img.jpg"

Everything is (naturally) pegged in the red, and the mix is perfect for this style of noisy fukkd hardcore. The bass is blown out, hollow and low end heavy, while the drums are buried in a wash of white cymbal noise with a flat snare drum getting brutalized just begging to be heard. Appropriately affected vocals battle for attention with the wall of guitar noise, but the vocals lose this battle, and will likewise lose all future contests with that six stringed ear destroyer. You know the comparisons by now - CONFUSE, DISORDER and so on - but DEFORMITY take UK82 simplicity, DBeat ferocity, and a whole shitload of high end distortion and make themselves a healthy racket.

RAW NERVES are a juggernaut as fierce as they are smart, it's a brand of crushing and apocalyptic hardcore that has seemingly gone the way of other bygone subgenres, but fuck if these eight tracks are not pure and total devastation. Influences from '90s US DIY hardcore and early '00s heavy melodic shits are defiantly in the forefront, but this sounds undeniably fresh and unbelievably powerful. Subtle metal tinges in the guitar (ok, there are a few leads in the slower bits that are not so subtle) and vocals strained to their absolute limit, this band slogs forward with an unwavering determination that makes the slower tunes arguable more important than their rippers - \"Not Getting Better\" is total perfection.

Pleasantly, the focus is not on Iggy (who is featured to be sure, but not until later the hour), but on the lesser known recordings rose up after THE STOOGES split. Ron Asheton's NEW ORDER (the opening track \"Victim Of Circumstance\" is worth the price of admission alone) and DESTROY ALL MONSTERS open up, with cutes from SONICS RENDEZVOUS BAND, IGGY POP (I mean, you're not going to leave the dude out of the equation, obviously) and closing out with some FRED SMITH + PATTI SMITH (though STOOGES adjacent, of course) live recordings that are killer, even if the quality is a little rough. Interviews with Asheton and Morgan provide context throughout, and once again Johnston's encyclopedic knowledge and fierce fandom make for a great listen as he dissects the cuts and the artists' lineage. You'd think that as he moved chronologically away from the architects that things would get a little more diluted and less interesting, but I think it just gets more interesting as the web gets wider....

Then again, I'm a couple of decades older than most punks, so it makes sense that my psyche would be stuck in some antiquated face-to-face perception of how interaction/s \"should\" occur and connections \"should\" be maintained. Plus, I of course participate in social media, so it's not like I'm complaining about \"the scene\" passing me by, I'm just acknowledging (and, to be fully transparent, lamenting) the pending expiration of actual human social interaction without technology. I'm not a luddite, though anyone publishing a daily music blog in 2019 is clearly not cutting edge....but I digress. I joined an existing instagram based mix tape exchange last month, and finished my first offering before I left town with Karoline (we are in Seattle as this is posted). The exchange is like a moderated white elephant - everyone answers the same simple questionnaire and the moderator matches participants based on common interests. My partner lives in Columbia, Missouri and likes \"classic heavy metal and grindcore.\" Asked what three bands s/he would kill to see? '99-'01 era SLIPKNOT, early '90s JANE'S ADDICTION, and PANTERA. Based on these parameters, I compiled Brain Concussion. I initially planned to make one side \"classic heavy metal\" and one side \"grindcore,\" but clearly I got sidetracked along the way....which is the whole point of making a mix tape. So I guess the internet ain't all bad, because making this thing was a blast...and when I get home I'm going to have someone else's creation waiting for me. Stay tuned.

Lynwood circa 2010 or so, I was either down with CONDENADA or N//N and POLISKITZO delivered their set through a hallucinogenic haze so thick that I felt like I was tripping too. And for just under seven minutes this morning I was back there, feeling wide eyed and out of place while an actual moment surrounded me. It was cool.

Fifteen untitled instrumentals circa Milwaukee 2006, fading into the background and then bringing you back with a lurch only to casually release you once again. Monotonous drones and hallucinogenic freaks, sometimes mellow and sometimes anything but. Track 6 is my personal go-to, essentially just an introduction to a piece that doesn't exist, but offering more introspection than most bands can muster with an entire record.

Allow me to explain (I mean, that's why you're here, right?) - that recycled flanged out '80s hardcore guitar (think DIE KREUZEN), that high energy stompy stomp, the dark vibes, all of the ingredients for a by-the-numbers modern sensation, except that SCAB EATER have fukkn fire. That guitar is joined by a second axe that just stabs the mix repeatedly, tearing holes in any kind of convention and exposing pure rage and power while the vocals are high, fervid and demanding. When everything else drops out you start to notice the ferocity of the low end (and once you do, you can't not notice it) and the assault is complete.....ugh, my friends, SCAB EATER is fukkn deadly. \"Blind//Bellicose\" gets my money for the choice cut, though it doesn't hurt that it's followed up by the low rumble and screaming gymnastics that make up the start of \"Crimes Against The Soil.\" Thankfully I don't really have to choose here - clocking in at exactly 600 seconds, Mind Trench is streamlined for repeat listens and receives highest accolades from TEHQ.\u00a0 MIND TRENCH"

AUS ROTTEN, SUBMACHINE and BEHIND ENEMY LINES members combined forces to create a wholly predictable juggernaut, and perhaps no one talked about it because no one was really surprised. Like, you knew CAUSTIC CHRIST was going to be amazing, so when you saw CAUSTIC CHRIST and they were, in fact, amazing, the response was more \"duh\" than \"holy shit.\" But listen to this shit 15 years later - all of the power and low end of turn of the millennium USHC crammed mercilessly into the '80s hardcore punk construct. At times it doesn't even work - like there's too much energy in play for them to still be going that hard, but they are definitely going that hard. This cassette from Rabid Dogs came shortly after they released the\u00a0Dark Thoughts comp (a C.O.C. tribute with HOLIER THAN THOU?, MUNICIPAL WASTE, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? and CAUSTIC CHRIST), and compiles the Can't Relate 12\", splits with R.A.M.B.O. and INTENSE YOUTH, the self titled EP on Havoc and a ripping nine track demo that I have never seen in the flesh. This shit is so much more intense in retrospect, and the live shows were something else entirely...I miss this hardcore, but fortunately (thanks to Felix and antiquated 1990s pressing ethos) these slabs are readily available and affordable for current and future punk generations.\u00a0 CAUSTIC CHRIST Above show was from 2002, one of my favorites on that tour, KYLESA didn't actually play, they stayed in Georgia after burning through two vans in the first three days, but it meant we had a lot of really killer flyers when we got home from tour.\u00a0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dEekUyKzaU&list=RD3dEekUyKzaU&start_radio=1&t=65 https://www.havocrecords.com/caustic-christ/lycanthropy-0 https://www.havocrecords.com/caustic-christ/government-job https://www.havocrecords.com/caustic-christ/caustic-christ"

Noise. Blinding noise in a pitch black room with a piercing strobe pointed directly at the (small) audience. Everything was in slow motion, and I was disoriented before the beats started....and then it started. That shrill daemon that had punctuated our show with insane outbursts and generally bizarre behavior all night....now it had a microphone, and now it had control. First there was the spectacle, and then it was enteractive....and I spell that with an \"e\" because The Entity I Will Call: DRMCRSHR was in your fukkn shit before you knew what was happening. One minute there was screaming in your face, then the lights went off and before you could see again there were two men rolling on the floor in a passionate embrace. I have, perhaps, never been that fukkd by a live performance. Reality and imagination were interchangeable, and it was as if, in between the rapid fire blinks of those lights, anything was possible. The sounds are relentless hi NRG techno/acid house distorted beyond anything approaching reasonable, and even out of the context of the live experience I highly recommend DRMCRSHR. But.....in the flesh. So much flesh. Listening to this tape as I type, I'm reminded how off balance I was when things returned to normal...the lights came up and sense of surroundings slowly returned - but those of us in that room\u00a0went somewhere.

I didn't know what it was, but it was a tape....so I picked it up, because why would you leave a tape sitting on the street? (found a Jonathan Richman record there a few weeks later that I snagged and then sold on the internet for $20 to a guy who said he \"knew me,\" so thanks, seating area) Turns out the sounds are solid as fukk ambient/synth/psych pieces with forays into goth (#07) and straight atmospheric noise (#12/13) that are every bit as successful as the more \"normal\" sounding tracks - and how much would I love an entire release based on that first track (#01) and its aggressive synth attack?

Like a cooption of sorts, it just didn't make sense. What does make sense after full exploration, however, is BRONCO LIBRE. I's not that they are good (and mind you, they are really good), it's that the thematic focus of the band heartfelt and honest, and it made me pause to think about all of the the \"international\" issues that First World political bands casually dip their feet into. BRONCO LIBRE dive in to the experience and the struggle lyrically, an attempt to identify more than empathize, and I leave this demo feeling stronger than I did when I pressed play....that's a serious accomplishment. That means you broke through. That means I'm coming back for more. Sonically there are similarities to NEON PISS, OBSERVERS, and high energy punk with a penchant for insanely catchy songs and killer guitars structures (the clean, the jangly, the distorted...all dancing together in harmony - it's like a metaphor for the life we want to live).

Did you know that South Carolina Public Radio has produced a syndicated program called Piano Jazz since 1978? I didn't either, until I came across this episode from 1981 featuring ALICE COLTRANE. Obviously, someone else came across it well before I did, because here it is packaged on cassette for (selected) public consumption. Her piano is magical, just as her voice is warm, considerate and contemplative during the interview segments with host Marian McPartland.\u00a0 With a breadth of work and influence that is almost incomprehensible, much of it still under the radar and (criminally) in the shadows of her late husband, I still find myself routinely floored when I discover a new segment of her output.

A pack of thrash mutants and suburban outcasts dishing out hyper fast metal while their frontman Pete went from the absolute nicest man in hardcore to a possessed animal frothing on stage. Their releases were packed with thanks lists and contact info for literally every band they came in contact with, and Pete would spend minutes listing every upcoming Bay Area punk show he could before launching the band into another 60 second barrage...the fact that they were on Relapse and existed (thrived, even?) outside of our Bay Area subculture was completely beyond me. At the risk of making this seem like a post about Pete (to be fair, I never met any of the other dudes), the band fukkn ripped. Always. Every time. But if I had seen them around the time this shit was recorded, I would have lost my mind. In '94, before BEN\u00dcMB were a full on thrash metal band, it appears that they were a devastating tortured hardcore outfit. The next eight minutes are unhinged low end madness - bass is the focus (shit man, I'm wondering...is it possible that they didn't have a guitar in the beginning? I can't remember. Someone help me out here?). The churn of \"Stagger Forward\" and the mania of \"Abstain\" take center stage, but every track here is legit. Thinking about what this band might have become had they channelled this shit into HC instead of metal is terrifying. Cheers, Pete.

Gangs of chorus vocals and lead yowls snarled with pure fury that almost completely masks melody. The riffs are infectious, but the maximum charge of the whole recording makes it hard to do anything but break shit. The leads here are more sparse than many of their contemporaries, allowing all encompassing raw power to take center stage. If the swarming madness of \"Meet My Dream\" isn't the jam that kicks you in the ass today, then you might need to reevaluate things (and \"Live On Alive\" might just be the track that reminds you why you're here - it's rare that anyone can drop a COMES comparison in the vocals, but here it is). For those trying to compartmentalize YUMEFUDA, they could perhaps get lumped in with bands like GESHPENST and ACCOMPLICE, though I think that might be more due to scene affiliations than actual style. From what I can gather, this demo, a screaming EP and a track on the all female Hard Core Mess Japankore Omnibus (with GAIA, SINK and others) is the extent of their output...but if the shit is this good then I will happily digest all nine tracks repeatedly.

With improvisational piano chops like his, Fats could have written his own history as an absolute giant of smooth swing, giving the instrument a voice of its own that made his instrumentals sing. Waller left a legacy of hundreds of credited compositions before his death on this day in 1943, several of which are included on this tape of two sets from the famous Yacht Club in 1938.

No matter for these ears, as the marriage of professional production and amateurish reproduction (in the form of cheap demos) is one that I fully endorse. Plenty of early METALLICA, both in the construction of the jams and the vocals, but these thrash maniacs are far from a run of the mill rehash, barreling through four breakneck headbangers packed with moshtastic breakdowns, monstrous backing vocals and flawless, screaming leads. The title track is the fukkn winner - an relentless fist banger that will leave you exhausted after just three minutes - while the closer \"Crabs\" is a classically moronic punk/thrash banger about parasitic testicular invaders...delivered with every ounce of the panache you would expect from a crew of thrashers from Brea, California.

Energetic Polish punk that nods at mid '80s UK anarcho (I'm thinking later SUBHUMANS) instead of the two chord UK82 stomp that is (and has been) so often emulated, these tracks were recorded in 1992 many also appear on the Wlka Czy Apatia?

I saw them in Cudahay, Wisconsin in 1993, got the self titled EP and was hopelessly hooked. I had never heard music like that, and I had never had music and attitude shoved in my face like that, and I loved it. As a geographically challenged late bloomer I missed out on the band's infancy, but consider myself lucky to have seen them at all. While scores of other bands have influenced musicians, even influenced genres, BORN AGAINST still manage to stand alone. No one sounds like them, and no scene sprouted up from their completely irreverent and sharp take on hardcore punk. No one, that is, except Albany's HAIL MARY. This demo is BORN AGAINST worship in its purest imaginable form, from the song structure to low end guitar yowls to the snarky bite of the atonal vocals. While I don't think this demo approaches any of the output of New York's finest shit stirrers, HAIL MARY crank out quality tunes on this 1997 demo, as they continued to do on a handful of EPs and one sweet 12\" platter during their brief run. \u00a0Now, who else has the first BORN AGAINST record on clear?

Joey introduced us to SCHLONG (who we loved, and Gavin built us a really really treacherous loft that lasted for several more tours), and Joey had been in a band called THE LJs with OPERATION IVY dudes. He also had some pretty intense interactions with a bunch of deceased musicians while we were on a bender in New Orleans, but that's a different story. Totally off the radar and freakishly proficient '90s East bay punk. Complete your collection.\u00a0 ZEBU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWHSncji8Dw"

The MORDRED tracks suffer from poor reproduction (and interruptions that I can only hope are someone's little sister pressing record on a teenage hessian's boom box), but the primitive power of \"Burned At The Stake\" cannot be hidden by a mere lack of fidelity, and this is easily my favorite jam on the tape. In the context of crucial mix tape construction, the choice of \"Guitarmony\" by ANVIL CHORUS to follow such a certified scorcher is questionable (not to mention exceptionally un-evil), so I'll suggest that this instrumental be used as a three minute cool-down before getting your face melted by some live Baloff & Company - who themselves get thrashed into the ground by ULYSSES SIREN fukkn screaming through three unrelenting tracks to close out the first side of the tape (the last of which is cut short by a poor mix tape planner - he was probably baby sitting his little sister though, so it's cool). Manic, technical and purely evil high end thrash insanity of the highest order. San Francisco's favorite teenage Filipino speed metal warriors DEATH ANGEL open the flip side with their seminal three track Kill As One demo from 1985, with the 11+ minute instrumental \"The Ultra-Violence\" still shining like a beacon of adolescent metal mastery (the drummer was fukkn 13 when they recorded this shit). And in case that instrumental isn't scary enough, two rippers from BLIND ILLUSION close out the side (a side once again prematurely cut off by a lack of preparation on the part of our baby sitting hessian). Get out your puffy white hi-tops, stuff a comb in the back pocket of your high waisted denims...and drink beer.

FAILINGS' brilliantly titled \"Heavy Cathedral Goth\" closes out the tape on a high note, but I will stop short of saying that it's my favorite track because all it did was inspire me to go back and re-listen to everything else.

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on February 18, 2011 Description from Terminal Escape: Lots of people who like modern heavy music worship at the altar of Scott \"Wino\" Weinrich. Wino's output has never thrilled me, and I think SAINT VITUS left their best work in the dust when original vocalist Scott Reagers departed in 1986, but his influence on the world of doom, stoner and heavy modern psychedlic rock cannot be understated or ignored. Bands like THE OBSESSED, THE HIDDEN HAND, SPIRIT CARAVAN and the current SHRINEBUILDER all seem to get people's panties moist, and I suppose I can see why, even though they all leave me rather uninspired...but this tape isn't about Wino's music: this tape is about the music that inspired Wino to make Wino's music. Wino made this tape for a dude named Edd (who I do not know) and then Edd copied it for my pal and fellow shitworker Andrew (who I do know). Andrew loaned it to me, since he knows that I like rock and roll, he knows I like cassettes, and he knows that the combination of the two, with the added stamp of cultural credibility that can only be given by a bona fide superhero, was too sweet to not share here on The Escape. SIDE OLD ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Side Old opens with early '70s UK rockers THREE MAN ARMY (opening track \"Polecat Woman\" is a total burner worth the whole tape on its own - even with the infrequent but unfortunate warbles towards the end of the song, and \"Butter Queen\" is an unfukkntouchable driving number); DUST (\"Suicide\" from Hard Attack is surely an oft shared jam, but it is also one of the best...a future RAMONE and that mind melting bass solo in the same song and I am helpless to resist); UK's QUARTZ had some scene crossover with late '70s era SABBATH, and with these two tracks as an introduction and considering the band released their first record the same year SABBATH released Technical Ecstacy, I'd say that QUARTZ deserved to move into the spotlight. Crank up Eastern Ohio's LEFT END, Florida's BANG (1971's crushing debut LP is well worth tracking down), and more unsung genius from more SABBATH proteges NECROMANDUS and the side starts to draw to a close. DAEMON are evil sounding, but they still boogie (an important quality in all '70s rock bands of note), while TRAPEZE take boogie-ing to lofty heights (this unsung band was a virtual training camp for UK hard rock band members, with personnel eventually joining the ranks of SABBATH, WHITESNAKE, DEEP PURPLE, JUDAS PRIEST and others) and CACTUS pound out the killer title track to their second LP. Escape alumni CAPTAIN BEYOND close out the first side of the tape with the same two tracks that close out the first side of their debut, and clean guitars have never sounded heavier. SIDE NEW ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Side New starts off with two Wino collaborations, the first with former DEATH SS guitarist Paul Chain (and again, the first track here is a spaced out crushing groove well worth the whole 60 minutes), and then with New Orleans sludge supergroup CLEAR LIGHT (the excessively psychedelic \"Veiled\" is my favorite tune on the side by far). ABDULLAH and MAMMOTH VOLUME close out the side and make me think about how much fun it must be to name new stoner rock projects.

Texans DEAD HORSE start the party with three tracks - this band was just a whisper to us Oklahomans at the time, but their tracks hold up brilliantly. BLUCK, crossover maniacs TRANSGRESSION, and downtuned churning primitive death metal from Alabama's RANDOM CONFLICT continue the battle while raw noisy hardcore from RADIATION SICKNESS and SKELETAL EARTH wrap up the first round. After a 6 minute death metal opus from NOCTURNUS, Tennessee's FOREVER UNGRATICAL CORINARIC TECHNIKILATION (F.U.C.T. - whose Dimensional Depth Perception full length completely melted my high school mind some 20 years ago) blaze two bombastic burners that are worth the whole download and are followed up by ripping old school HC from fellow Tennessee denizens REDNECKS IN PAIN. CONFRONTATION dish out three tracks (one from their 1989 EP), and we take a trip to the Northeast for legendary weed thrashers EXIT 13 and PHLEGM, who offer three more each to close out the party.

Toronto's FUCKED UP are probably well known to most of you as a band who released a few killer EPs, followed them up with a confusing but still pretty darn good double LP, and then parlayed their self generated hype machine into a bizarre form of mainstream credibility and what is shaping up to be a wholly uninteresting catalog of recorded material on Matador and Vice. But before they dove headfirst into their own hooplah and started making yawn inducing records, FUCKED UP released this mix tape to entertain listeners, debut some songs that were new to those not lucky enough to have seen the band live (I've seen them only once, in 2004 in Chicago, and I was kinda pissed that they were awesome - when everyone says a band rules, there's a part of me that wants to hate them...but they were too damn good, and I couldn't do it), and shine the spotlight on some other new Toronto bands. URBAN BLIGHT, PINK EYE, TERMINAL STATE, NUBS, BRUTAL KNIGHTS, NUBS, UNDERTONES, DIRTY BLACK SUMMER and CAREER SUICIDE are all featured, but various FUCKED UP blips, live bits and interview snippets keep this from rolling like just another ordinary mix tape.

Simultaneously insistent and dreamy, their vaguely goth/new wave by way of anarcho punk should be perfectly suited for legions of '00s punks struggling to embrace '80s roots that they never actually had. Also, INTERNAL AUTONOMY are really fukkn good. Vocals take center stage, a howling caterwaul that relaxes into a lilting monotone when the music requires it. Decidedly more melodic and subdued than earlier demos, this mysterious 5th Demo ventures into what might have been college radio fodder in an alternate universe, but then there are certified UK punk bangers (like the third track) to remind you where these folks are really coming from. The final seven songs that make up the second side of this tape are are demo gold - drum machine rehearsals, blown out and way more \"out there\" than the studio efforts. Genuine gems, interesting oddities...the final three tracks might be the result of one dude in a bedroom with hallucinogens and a 4-track, but the result is mesmerizing and well worthy of release on its own. But today it is presented to you the same way it was presented to me, because that's the way it should be. 5th DEMO //1.bp.blogspot.com/-orhdfk-lhCQ/UuH1SUPfGxI/AAAAAAAAJYc/Qa0n7l8gXpw/s1600/internal+Autonomy+5.jpg"

I mean, I also hate fun, so there's that, but why the fukk would you want to spend any (much less excessive) effort to play someone else's songs? Once. It's not like you are the Saturday night band at the beach bar....no one ACTUALLY cares what you are doing after tonight, which means (in my humble but correct) opinion) that you have been (at best) merely pandering to your friendly acquaintances (real friends like me would tell you that cover shows are dumb) or (at worst) completely wasting your time. In 2016 the only thing that made me think about changing my mind was LOS PUNK ROCKERS, a crew of utterly inept mutants butchering a set of SEX PISTOLS tracks. In 2017 the only thing that made me think about changing my mind was LOS PUNK ROCKERS, a crew of inept mutants butchering a set of RAMONES tracks. Also...RAMONES are totally overrated. Listen to the old recordings - they weren't that fast OR that hard, and they were Republicans. There are tracks, to be sure (we should be clear on this: Animal Boy and Too Tough To Die\u00a0are the only RAMONES albums actually worth owning or listening to - the first couple have a few tracks each, but so do Back In Black and ZOSO....and even ifyou are chill when that shit comes on while you are digging ditches at work, you don't actually want to put that shit on in your house.....do you?), but who actually puts on Rocket To Russia? No one. LOS PUNK ROCKERS give these RAMONES tracks the spirit and the energy and the lack of fukks that stupid punk rock songs require - nay: DEMAND - to actually feel subversive and/or relevant. If you're wondering how many shits LOS PUNK ROKCERS give, I can tell you without even answering them: ZERO. None. They just beat the shit out of the shit on Halloween once a year....and I hope that 2018 will bring be an interpretation of THE CLASH, who are also overrated.\u00a0 LOS PUNK ROCKERS"

After opening with the innocence of \"Stained Glass,\" \"Card Crane Ha\" conjures STEREOLAB, \"Dented In The Bag\" is a perfect guitar driven pop song (kudos on the blatant SMITHS rip - no criticism, just an observation), and \"Bliss\" closes like a damaged NEU! by way of PTARMIGAN....and it's all great. Only four cuts, and this cassette is now almost seven years old, but MOON have been active in the years since - and they've spent that time honing their craft and focusing their vision.

I toured with LOST GOAT twice in 1999, one of my favorite stints on the road with three fantastic people. Tina brought this tape with us, and it was absolutely perfect for late night drives and quiet lulls while everyone was napping. The side titled 78s From The Moon & TX sounds like exactly that, 8 tracks of crackling sound from times and places far removed from our reality. Through the power of technology I was able to identify XAVIER COUGAT, TEX RITTER and LOS CHURUMBELES de ESPA\u00d1A (the power involved holding my phone up to the computer and asking Mr. Shazam who the fukk I was listening to, in case you were wondering), but the other five artists are a mystery, which doesn't make them any less wonderful to the ears. On the flip, Korean '70s garage/psych star CHOO JA KIM. Six tracks taken from one of her (many) greatest hits releases, laid back and far the fukk out, with a voice suggesting a beauty every bit as real as the woman behind it. Picture NANCY SINATRA with JEFFERSON AIRPLANE and present it through the acid filter of the early 1970s and you'll be in the ballpark - listen in the dark and you'll be in love. 78s FROM THE MOON & TX // CHOO JA KIM //1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qlk6XGqtWdA/T_brorZUw2I/AAAAAAAAC9Q/pnq-8HaIHrc/s1600/78s+from+the+moon.jpg //1.bp.blogspot.com/-9Fi9WZmYD08/T_bs4cw6d0I/AAAAAAAAC9Y/ybAGP2fMRoU/s1600/choo+ja+kim.jpg"

I bought a few other things that day, but this is the one that I feel like I walked in for - you know what that's like? As if the other thing that you wanted was actually just a thing that was leading you to this. I can't describe MENTAL ANGUISH, but this dude was on (is on) and entirely different trip. Like a no budget '80s alien movie soundtrack come to life in this realm (Residue is from 1987, so in that realm as well), these are sounds of electronic isolation and theoretical escape. With over 100 releases to his name it's clear that I will never reach the bottom of this well, but I want to meet the MENTAL ANGUISH completist.

The label that became synonymous with commercial shopping mall mass marketed sonic enlightenment (whether or not this characterization was just is up for debate) started as a humble, honest and fascinating collection of experimental artists from the Bay Area making truly interesting, and often very wonderful, sounds. What does that little nugget of wisdom have to do with MONKS OF THE BALHILL....? Not a fucking thing, except that listening to the opening five minutes of \"Andy Trotter Jumped Into The Fire\" kinda made me think about that early catalog. This release descends into darkness of course, melting those early Ackerman LPs and drinking the ensuing sludge. Like a distant train in the night, two French Vincents make sound dance off of mountains whose silhouettes are obscured by the very weight of the night air. And the primitive synths move closer, rising....enter obligatory and/or unnecessary dawn metaphors.\u00a0Ten Ways To Get Out Of The Water offers but two.

The demo closes out with a ripping KBD worthy track called \"Video,\" but it's the opener that really wins me over...\"Last Punk\" is a damn near perfect punk song. \u00a0The tempo sits uncomfortably, I keep wanting it to speed up or slow down - it does neither -\u00a0and the intensity swells and the vocals turn to snarls before the song slowly starts to deflate and in the end\u00a0it just kind of collapses in a sea of reverb. \u00a0From KFTH, I can guess that there is at least one more piece of brilliance from PAGAN IDOLS out there, another demo tape from the following year. \u00a0Until that miracle happens, these 7 songs will keep me happy to be a punk.

Like an actual physical dervish manifested behind the kit and just went fucking insane - but that more or less describes the entire recording. This was recorded in 2013, but no release information is available aside from the recent (re) issue on Nihilistic Mortality. The band has members associated with CORPSPAZM\u00a0(and probably the label itself), but mostly the band is fucking deadly. There two buried cuts in addition to the five listed listed offerings, followed by a killer Hector Lavoe track that either means they used a recycled tape or they have good taste tempered with a sense of humor...I'm voting for the latter.

Described as a \"crossover\" composition (just not the kind of crossover frequently covered in these annals), jazz pianist/composer Claude Bolling wrote this piece for a jazz trio and flute because...well, because no one had done that before. His approach to jazz is relatively standard - no freakouts here, no incomprehensible time signatures, the kind of jazz your vanilla ass parents could totally get down with. He kinda shreds the piano in \"Sentimentale\" though, and he was pals with Oscar Peterson, so respect. Jean Pierre Rampal, for his part, was a square ass French flautist (that's a person who plays the flute, you imbecile) who played a solid fukkn gold flute (true story). Bolling wrote the shit, Rampal joined his trio, and BOOM they sold millions of records to people like my parents. I picture this record in the living rooms of adults who owned 20 LPs, and this was the beginning and end of their \"cultured\" genre, proving that they didn't just listen to Bob Seger or (in my parents' case) THE CARPENTERS. That said, it's actually a pretty pleasant listen, even today. It doesn't slay or anything like that...but it's pretty easy on the ears, and I guess it kinda sounds like spring....whatever that means. Also, I not only still have my folks' vinyl copy, but this cassette that I have kept hauling around with me for twenty plus years for some unknown reason...so I guess that makes me a square grown up now.

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on June 26, 2011 Description from Terminal Escape: FUCKFACE crossed paths with WHITE TRASH SUPERMAN twice on our 1995 US tour. First in Biloxi, Mississippi, where we played with five touring bands and a couple of local ska acts in a rented hall, and then in New Orleans on afternoon that followed the most exceptional (frightening) displays of alcohol consumption I have ever seen (participated in) and our drummer was still talking to his dead friends (out loud) while we were playing. The following year, we got towed to a show they arranged for us sometime near Christmas (I can't recall if it was in Starkville or Columbus, and I don't remember if WTS or Jayson's next band THE GRUMPIES played...I just know it was real close to Jesus's birthday, and kids got crazy - perhaps because they were\u00a0crazy). WHITE TRASH SUPERMAN are from Starkville, Mississippi, and their songs will seep under your skin and melt your icy jaded veins...this tape and their other demo were on heavy rotation in the van for many tours to come, and we were happy to spread the word to friends back home. Their sound is dredged through '90s poppy punk, but their delivery is all adrenaline and alcohol, placing them somewhere between HICKEY and SUPERCHUNK on my \"awesome melodic bands from the '90s\" meter. These tracks became WHITE TRASH SUPERMAN's only two EP's, Punk Rock Hero and Couldn't (If I Tried) b/w Wheaties, both released in 1995 or so. \"Couldn't (If I Tried)\" is as close to a perfect song as I've ever heard, and the words still get stuck in my head on a regular basis. The other two songs on this tape, \"Can Man\" and \"Staring At Your Walls,\" never made it to wax, but they are both brilliant in the same innocently mature manner as \"Couldn't (If I Tried),\" and shows a band years more advanced than their actual years. In a different world, WHITE TRASH SUPERMAN would have (should have) been playing to hundreds of college punk fans for the last half of the decade, but in our world, they recorded brilliant songs themselves on a 4-track, released the songs themselves on cassette and EP (using the imprint Did It Ourselves Records), and filled a handful of lives with memories. That's a pretty nice legacy.

Punks and punk adjacent metalheads started chattering about these bands from Scandinavia, of course there were the churches and shit that gave the whole thing an element of 'hmmmm, this is interesting' even beyond the music. On tour in 1995, FUCKFACE came across an interview with BLACK FUNERAL and we clowned that dude relentlessly in the van (later found out he worked at a Pizza Hut in Indiana and lived with his mom) before we used a quote from the interview as the center label for the Don't Hate Us 'Cause We're... EP and still...black metal was just curiosity. Meanwhile, black metal was consuming the scene in San Francisco - Lucifer's Hammer started hosting shows on Tuesdays and were responsible for MAYHEM, MORTIIS, EMPEROR, IMPALED NAZARENE and countless others playing a dive bar on Folsom street...on a Tuesday. And while this was happening....people were starting bands, and these bands made it very fucking clear to casual consumers that this new 'thing' was much more than a curiosity; this shit was for real. There was UNHOLY CADAVER - a recording project that came out of THUNDERCHIMP and evolved into HAMMERS OF MISFORTUNE. There was LUDICRA, who featured the guitarist from HAMMERS OF MISFORTUNE, the guitarist from MISSILE COMMAND, and the drummer from HICKEY along with Jessika from a drunk band called KETAMINE.And then....there was WEAKLING...WEAKLING were different, and 1999's Dead As Dreams is as much a genre defining record as anything I can conjure. The drummer from SANGRE AMADO, the guitarist from FUCKING CHAMPS and the dude from VOMITORIUM made something that changed everything.\u00a0 And then in 2023 this dude I know wanted to sell a bunch of tapes and I offered to help him more the units.....couldn't put a price tag on the WEAKLING tape so after some friendly discussions it lives with me now. This shit is so important (to me) that I don't give two shits how important the band was (is) in general - no one in North America did this better. Period. And this is seventy five minutes of proof.These tapes were dubbed off sporadically - I never saw this for sale anywhere....you got a copy of this if you were there, you dig? So I am honored to give this copy a (new) home.

Four compositions, electronic sunrise ragas pulsing out of a modular reality, elements patched together with intent.

Take the fast parts of \"Apartheid,\" the disjointed intro to \"Sin Raz\u00f3n\" that launches into primitive Bay Area thrash or the entirety of a ripper like \"Falsa Civilizaci\u00f3n\"- these moments make the foreshadowing easy to overlook and dig TRAUMA in their infancy.

I have had a different HINGE recording floating around since that era, but I snagged this one from Daniel when he was purging a couple of summers ago, and it's way better than the one I've been listening to. Four tracks of impassioned basement DIY with a heavy DC influence and killer swarms of guitars. I've said it countless times in these pages, but I miss bands having the freedom to write like this without instant access to every subgenre at their fingertips...I miss songs like \"How The West Was Won\" popping onto tapes and steering your listening in an entirely different direction. So whether I saw HINGE or not, I'm glad to have the sounds. And if, in fact, didn't see them? Well, it was a really good make out session, so no regrets. HINGE"

The presentation is instrumental, but no words are needed to convey the sorrow - Failures is every bit as bleak as the COLUMN OF HEAVEN...

Fortunately for me there is no shortage of bands that walk the line between brilliance and incompetence, and I am happy to present one here for you to enjoy. New Jersey's TRIGGERVISION could just as easily be classified as a noise or industrial band with their heaps of effects piled upon every part of their minimalist recording, but no matter what you call them, these tracks are a beautiful nasty hot mess, and in 1987, I have no doubt that this trainwreck was fucking punk as shit. Long drawn out dirges, reverb laden vocals and excessive knob twiddling, the end of \"Bullet In My Head\" is pure TG worship (whether intentionally or not), if only I had been lucky enough to hear this carnage when I was 15...I would have gone fucking bananas! There's a little page for them from Earwax Retro Fanzine, where there's also dozens of other marginally known or completely unknown New Jersey bands (warning, its easy to get lost). I would love to hear their other tape release (hint), and in the future I'll be posting the On The Edge and The Will To Die tape comps that are listed on the TRIGGERVISION page. Luckily for me, and now you, some dude in New Jersey 20-25 years ago was good at trading shit...now blast some noise.

Full speed ahead DBeat rooted in earnest US hardcore, these seven tunes sneak up on you and grab you by the throat. The natural distortion when Ruby yells \"the improbable dream\" is the turning point when I feel like this demo goes from compelling to devastating - a practice space recording with a mix that fluctuates enough from song to song to keep perking your ears up without ever sacrificing power or impact. Listen to \"All Of The Horrible Potential Of The Universe\" and you actually start to grit your teeth a bit, which I'm sure is the desired effect (or at least an acceptable side effect). Now that the lineup is solid, I fully expect THE LIGHT to become a force...and it's pretty cool to watch people I play in bands with play in a band together.

Maybe this isn't one of those nuggets - the music is too powerful to dismiss with that moniker, and the vocals owe more to '80s UK animal rights anarcho/crust - but dammit I can't even read anything on the wrap around xeroxed J-card or the lyrics insert, just the mangled text scrawled on the shell. Therefore: Mysterious. Wall/s of tortured guitars, a stark coldness to the overall approach, when they slow to a stomp (as on \"III\" and especially the beginning of \"VI\") the will to break everything is almost overwhelming, and there's a lot of PENI buried in this mysterious cassette. Plus blast beats. There's also one riff that's a dead straight PANTERA rip but I think I only notice that because I listened to Vulgar Display Of Power too much on one tour in the mid-'90s. Don't judge. Someone's gonna tell me who/what this is and I'm going to think \"oh yeah, shit, of course that's who this is\"...but until then, I'll just say that this shit bangs hard, and the layout/presentation is reminiscent of John Patrick McKenzie, whose art and perspective wows me to this day.\u00a0 \u00a0LET IT DRAIN FROM ME There's a quarter hour of ominous (or....mysterious?) tape feedback and christian shit at the end of the band recording. It seriously will fuck you up if you listen at volume, and I'd say there's better than 50/50 odds that this is the result of a repurposed cassette and not \"art.\" However, the result makes you feel queasy inside and I think that, in general terms, it's better to feel than to not feel.\u00a0 Now and at the hour of our death....Amen. https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-slXrnUOVGCQ/Xpcz-dDRw_I/AAAAAAAAW_o/UFzFD88pIvIw1MGyu3dDwDLMPRHDAj2xQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/I%2BDie%2BIn%2BThe%2BLight%2Boutside%2Bcopy.jpg https://www.creativityexplored.org/artists/john-patrick-mckenzie https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fSlfOobv62c/Xqxj0ilLbWI/AAAAAAAAXFs/P9SBU5HQc_QRb3g2UB7YwJQeFZRP7HZggCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Light%2Bimg1.jpg https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XlvKes272gc/Xqxj7JghB1I/AAAAAAAAXFw/UcyY66nRAxkb1iY8xyghJC4DVUZkyEcugCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Light%2Bimg2.jpg https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fXvKA7iUh7E/XqxkArs2hjI/AAAAAAAAXF0/I7RmpCwber4ml1wrgKYynIXnJo1JsE7cwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Light%2Bimg%2B3.jpg"

The emotional investment is worth it, and the sonic reward is indescribable - fill the cracks between GODFLESH, Kevin Shields' guitar, EMACIATOR, SKULLFLOWER and primitive industrial experimentation...and fill the cracks in your self at the same time.\u00a0 FEAR THE HEX https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aUQH9byr5fs/XJ0iKMOPGkI/AAAAAAAAU80/NByFzltYmF4fs93YFibRb-zYQ0ckpr9VgCLcBGAs/s1600/Korperschwache%2Bimg.jpg"

Terminal Escape faves YADOKAI disintegrated into SCALPED a couple of years ago (only change in membership was one guitarist) and then as soon as your knuckles hit the floor they were gone and PRIMAL RITE appeared (change in membership this time was the vocalist). SCALPED took YADOKAI's erratic lurches and yanked out enough of the Japanese hardcore to make it real confusing - a start/stop/breakdown riff-o-rama from the first burst of sound. There are only six minutes of mayhem on this demo, and it runs essentially as one track, one collection of riffs, one continuous bash to the face. I honestly prefer this practice space demo to any of the band's \"studio\" recordings - rawer, more teeth, more chaos....uglier. And this is a band that was, from its inception, decidedly ugly.\u00a0 DEMO: 2014 https://primalrite.bandcamp.com/"

The were catchy and aggressive, but you could still shake your ass - in fact sometimes you just couldn't help yourself.

And second I urge you to look at the track listing closely, because this one is different from that one. And besides, Chicago bands from the '90s who never really toured don't get enough press, and PRONOUNCED DEAD deserves way more press than punk will ever give them, so why the hell shouldn't I heap a little more on? Exactly, because the shit is so damn deadly.

They were from Ardmore, Oklahoma, and they appeared one autumn (probably 1991?) as classes ramped up, and they just seemed so serious and so generally legit to my little crew of weirdos and dorks. They were also really fucking good. I'm going to make an analogy that is going to sound completely off, but please hear me out.....THE SYMPHONY were to Oklahoma college town grunge/punk what DEAD AND GONE were to Bay Area hardcore. This is to say that we (the \"rest\" of us) basically got what they were doing, but they were light years ahead of us. The way they wrote songs and approached songwriting, they way they owned their influences and used them as fuel - influences that put them in league with the bands who influenced the bands who influenced bands that we liked - and I still hear all of that when I listen to this tape today.

Tracks from a few early '00s vinyl releases and live shows, they rip through a few dozen bangers in just under an hour, catchy fast hardcore mingling with amped up melodic Eurocrust and blistering fastcore with a more than casual nod to their contrymen form the '80s - and everything pegged in the red for added intensity. The live tracks show a band that I would love to see in person, maximum energy without sacrificing chops and an excellent partner for the blown out studio tracks that make up half of the tape. 40+ songs in all, and I'm virtually certain that I fukkd up the titles somewhere along the line...I would apologize if I was actually sorry, but I was chair moshing too hard to really care.

The 5 minute \"Sharon Days\" could be a BIRTHDAY PARTY/DOORS hybrid, and then they follow it with \"Life Not Dead,\" which basically sounds like the previous cut but on klonopins. Dreary, meandering tracks that drunkenly swagger with a confidence that shines a light to the fog, as if to remind you that CROSS know exactly what they are doing, that the apparent lack of direction (or motivation?) is nothing more than a ruse to tempt you to move along. Don't fall prey. It's a trap. The thing you will move along to is boring and predictable. Stick around for a while. Get weird.

What follows is the best hour of under appreciated US hardcore punk...Mississippi's WORKIN' MUTHAS, Idaho's STATE OF CONFUSION, Michigan's BORN WITHOUT A FACE, Wisconsin's US DISTRESS (from the original K-Town), S.N.O.T. from Texas, STEVIE STILETTO, BLEMISH ON SOCIETY, HEADLESS MARINES and MAGGOT SANDWICH from Florida, Virginia's PSYCHODRAMA (their song \"No Homo Zone\" was clearly recorded well before the emergence of politically correct punk politics), Alabama's DISPERSION, and then there's GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS (weirdest song on the tape) from Chicago and bands from parts unknown like BONG and POISON. Musical styles all sit in between the world of '80s American punk and '80s American hardcore, and the quality is way higher than one might expect from a tape comp of unheralded bands - though STEVIE STILETTO is marginally appreciated by punk historians and MAGGOT SANDWICH are generally recognized as a solid second tier (and therefore relatively affordable) hardcore act - plus, I dig their mustaches. I asked Aesop about this shit, since a healthy percentage of these bands are from Florida, but he just told me that BLEMISH ON SOCIETY were terrible (though I kinda dig their shitty songs here, if only because they are so shitty) and MAGGOT SANDWICH ruled (which I already knew). I was kinda hoping for a story about 15 year old Aesop fucking the drummer for DISPERSION's girlfriend in the back of their van while they played a show in Florida, just because that would have been funny...not such luck.

I liked the TROUBLED SLEEP cover art, reminds me of a picture that used to hang on the wall in our old house, so I paid a little more attention and I am glad that I did. The sounds are pure early '90s college/indie bliss a la Simple Machines, and they harness a young John K level songwriting (and in some cases, the lyrics are approaching that level also), and the four songs here led me to the internet (hint: you're already halfway there!) where I found song after song after song and got lost for an excellent couple of hours.

Screaming '80s heavy metal, strutting through Pigalle in search of the next sleazy strip club, tight leather and frills galore - every track on this tape would have owned a Sunset Strip Battle Of The Bands any time before 1985. DEMON EYES mix classic Vince Neil vocals with a touch of NWOBHM, while SORTILEGE flirt with dark power metal a la MAIDEN and MORS\u00dcRE dish out blistering double bass driven speed metal (their eponymous track is a face melting burner). \u00a0Classic driving heavy metal from SPEED QUEEN, ANYWAY and STOCKS flows nicely into a slightly more amped up version of the same animal from KILLERS and mid-era SCORPS meets Vengeance-era PRIEST from H-BOMB. \"Rock Suicide\" from ATTENTAT ROCK is sometimes my favorite jammer, but then there are times when the raw power of S.M.F. has me hitting rewind.

DESPERATE MEASURES' opening tune \"1984\" with its simple droning repetitious riff might be the best song of the next 90 minutes (a bold move when making a mix tape), but the entirety of their 1984\u00a0EP is included here, and it's a fucking winner start to finish. Five tunes from UNRESTFUL MOMENTS follow, classic snotty punk with killer HUSKER DU-esque guitar leads set to brooding music with bizarrely affected (with effects, no doubt) vocals. THIS SPORTING LIFE appeared on the last New Zealand mix that I posted, brilliant post punk that mustn't be missed, and side A closes out with a phenomenal female fronted, horn laden track from INSTIGATORS that gives their British namesake a serious run for the money. The flipside is packed with goodies from JOHNNIES, 1ST IV (whose quirky jams like \"Fascist Tango\" are entirely too infectious), NEOTERIC TRIBESMEN's post punk arty goodness, two tracks of excellent JOY DIVISION worship from CHILDREN'S HOUR, straightforward punk from AFTERSHOCK and FINAL SOLUTION, plus two songs from RIOT III that question my theory that DESPERATE MEASURES take the prize on this mix....the song \"Move To Riot\" by RIOT III might just surpass DEAD KENNEDYS' \"Riot\" as my favorite riot song ever (and for the record, the word 'riot' appeared in that sentence quite a few times). As with Australian punks from the same era, there's just something tweaked about most of these recordings - something that makes them strangely kiwi, even though I don't quite know what that means. Hats off to the fellow and/or lass who crafted this mix, because I'm completely smitten with the music in contains...as you will be once these bands enter your musical database.

A few blocks away from Celebrated Summer, around the corner from an Indian/Italian take out joint that offers a fierce (but over priced) Chana Masala, is a less cool record store packed with average rock and jazz records. But this record store (I cannot remember the name) is also rammed with genuinely interesting cassette oddities and a shitload of reggae/dub, outsider and jazz records that made me wish I had way more time to investigate.

Well apply all of those accolades to today's collection of bands from South Africa. Chaotic live anarcho/thrash from OUTRAGE (who have previously visited The Escape) and a chunk of commercial metal/grind from GROINCHURN, probably that country's best known punk or metal export, but everything else on this mix was new to my ears. Melodic '90s punk from FUNGY GONE WEST and CRUSH, while DIMINISHED RETURN play charging metallic hardcore with UK punk vocals, and DEVIATE are heavy grinding metalcrust. INFECTIOUS OUTBREAK (total weirdo/anarcho art/grind), THE GLEE CLUB (FROGS meets TEENAGE FANCLUB), and FRIDGE MAGNET (average punk, but the chorus just repeats \"Police Stupidity\" so I'm kinda into it) make appearances, but the highlights for me are the bands that start and end the tape. Seven tunes from FUCT OFF kick off the A side, raw and forceful UK influenced politically charged punk - simple but absolutely killer songs (these tracks are really raw, sounds like a several generations old recording...would love a cleaner version if anyone's holding?). And the whole thing ends up with BATTERY 9, a commercially successful dance/industrial band from the mid '90s - these two tracks were my introduction, and inspired me to get lost down an internet rabbit hole searching out more music from this duo. Land Of\u00a0Rape And Honey-era MINISTRY meets POP WILL EAT ITSELF as a lazy reference, great shit. This is why mix tapes rule...again. SOUTH AFRICAN MIX TAPE"

Sweden's AKAKABUTO eliminate the divisions between raw Swedish hardcore, breakneck fastcore and euro crossover shits, and they create a complete fukkn monster in the process. Metallic guitars mostly concealed by a perfectly rough recording (I'm talking 1983 rough, not practice space rough), they blow through nine tracks in ten short minutes - stops, blasts, moshes...and gloriously fast hardcore. As if they were on a road between UNSEEN TERROR and ANTI-CIMEX and got lost after they stopped in Y2K to get gas and snacks.

LIFE CHAIN were from Halifax. A few years ago I posted a different LIFE CHAIN demo that was also from 2014 and was also really good (see earlier parenthetical comment). I'm not sure if there's a theme brewing here, but if you're into bands who released two or more ripping cassette in 2014, then I recommend LIFE CHAIN. One time they were playing a festival in Oakland and I was late but I really wanted to see them play so I rolled up anyway. It wasn't a cheap festival, but I dropped $30 and walked into the back room just as LIFE CHAIN were about to play. I lost my shit. They were great. Then shortly after the next band started there was a stupid fight and I thought \"this is stupid, and LIFE CHAIN were fukkn great,\" so I just went home and didn't feel even remotely ripped off. $30 well spent. My point is that bands who released two (or more) crucial demos in 2014 should be noticed and appreciated. LIFE CHAIN is one of those bands. \u00a0NO LAUGHTER"

Breath giving way to a physical silence until the only thing left in this moment is the deafening sound of your struggle. The life that has (always) crushed you metaphorically manifests as that hand on your throat, and you control the knob (or button, or key...you control the key) - you control the flow of sound. The flow of air. And the volume increases. You increase the volume and you suffocate. And then it's over. You are released and you can breathe...and you look at the symbol like the head of an arrow pointing to the right as you feel your heart working harder to return you to a normal but you can still feel the sound linger. You can still feel that hand lingering...your hand lingering. And you look at that head of an arrow and you think: \"Just seven minutes...I can do it again. I am strong.\" And you you press play. Or you click that head of an arrow. Or you let your system repeat automatically. Or you use whatever tool the Modern Generation uses to make things louder. To make things more. And it starts again.\u00a0AUTRAUMATIC"

Breathy and deliberately adorable, their songs are like CODEINE on 'ludes, with guitars floating through an evening sky thick with memories of lost love and a shroud of whispered promises. If Nick Cave were a well adjusted suburban adolescent with none of his malice but all of his vision, these are the the songs he would write for his girlfriend...or maybe it's the music Wayne Coyne will make when he is 80 years old, and CIGARETTE are just ahead of their time. BLUSH! NO STATIK plays in Reno tonight. It's in a house, the one where the punks are. Look for it, it's close to the casino where I'm going to win a lot of money tonight.

It's not just the sheer quantity (there were a lot of notable outfits), but the quality (there were a lot of notably good outfits). Maybe SEX VID planted a seed or some shit, or maybe punks from Olympia have just been drinking from the same mysterious fountain for generations. Last week it was ESC\u00d8RT, and today we get a visit CRUDE THOUGHT's first demo released in 2011. Fuzzed out bass and guitar that come together like a soft poo smooshing through a window screen, an awkward stilted pace and vocals that...well, CRUDE THOUGHT mean it, you know? CRUDE THOUGHT sounds fukkn real and you can feel it, you know?\u00a0 At the end of the day I don't really care where they were from (the Olympia thing is still impressive, of course), because CRUDE THOUGHT exist now, in a time and a place where you need them to.

The DESKONOCIDOS full length is a true modern classic to my ears, but it had been a (long) while since I had pumped the early recordings compiled on this 2010 cassette. Nothing sounded like it then, even while you can hear the bands they were listening to in their own sound/s. And does it hold up....?

If you think about it, we vilified and/or rolled our eyes at the bands slogging away at the townie bar playing LED ZEP or FOGHAT inspired blues based rock to 15 casually interested patrons on a Tuesday, because obviously that was a sound and a scene that was without merit and/or totally lame. Well, that was 25 years ago (for me), and I can definitely recall spending relatively recent weeknights at townie bars with 15 other casually interested patrons, enjoying the shit out of bands playing music that owed liberally to other bands that ceased to exist a lifetime ago. And those nights were great, and those nights are still great, and I hope that those nights will continue to be great long after I am willing and/or able to participate....because punk rules. Punk rules just like that post high school burnout working the fryer at Garfield's back in Ponca City thought CREAM ruled back in '88 when I got a job there and I thought he was a lame burnout because he wasn't hip to THE CURE like I was.\u00a0 DETOX DETOX could be from Los Angeles, Seattle or Tallahassee (they are from St. Louis). DETOX could be from 2017 or from 1986 (likely not 1982, just because it doesn't sound quite that legit and they thank D4 so they are probably from the '90s). DETOX could be DIY champions or rock club frat punks. The members of DETOX could have been teenagers who grew up and went on to form other bands that you might actually care about, or they could be just one of the thousands of North American bands that decided (wisely) to play punk rock music and record it for us to listen to before quietly disappearing because weeknight life at the townie bar can get pretty old after a while. Either way, I am glad that they did, because punk rules....and the track \"Ripoff\" is legit in every way and reminds me of NAKED HIPPY. Fortunately, the other three songs rip just as much.\u00a0 https://www.garfields.net/"

FATIGUE was a ripping early '90s melodic hardcore band who put their songs on a tape that eventually made its way to me with no background, just song titles. I say early '90s just because...well, listen to it and tell me this doesn't sound like it was recorded around '93 or so? Hints of SNFU, BAD RELIGION, early NOFX, and the whole thing smacks of a time when \"melodic\" and \"catchy\" didn't mean pulling punches or taking your foot off the gas. There are tracks like \"Bite\" and \"Falling Over My Keys\" that come off like early OFFSPRING, but irreverent rippers like \"Alcomohol\" more than compensate. Two separate recordings here, the first batch of tracks are definitely more polished and aggressive while the second are decidedly more amateurish but no less capable (and yes, I realize that \"Cheers!\" and \"Ahhhh Shit!!!\" are ridiculous, but I find that both are signs of the times as much as the style of punk FATIGUE is playing). So yeah, check out FATIGUE, and also FATIGUE have a single on Warthog Speak that is quite good. FATIGUE http://warthogspeak.com/news"

Or the band could have been named I FORGOT. But pop this one in and there are only more questions - the sound is a clash of Bay Area pop punk, Revolution Summer and '90s Midwest basement emo, the second track (which might be titled \"Stupid Melodic Song\") is a perfect example of the melodic punk that was so pervasive in the mid 1990s (splitting hairs here - but I'm talking about a different brand of melodic punk than yesterday's BRAINSICK demo)...and I don't know anything else except that this band could have played the Mission Punk Fest in 1997 and kids would have eaten them up like candy.

We played with AMDI PETERSENS ARM\u00c9 and TRAGEDY at Gilman and Billy was wearing a bright fukkn red LA FRACTION shirt and it just stuck out, you know? It wasn't black, it didn't look \"punk\" in the generic sense of the descriptor, and it just stuck out. I knew all those dudes, it's not like we were tight or anything, so I didn't ask about the shirt and just kinda filed it away mentally....to be addressed later. And then five years later their third LP\u00a0La Vie R\u00eav\u00e9e dropped and I was driving that French band on their US/Canadian tour, a tour that included a boat in Texas and threats of violence in San Francisco and and drugs and botched border crossings at Niagra Falls and a crazy ass frontman in Pittsburgh and a show with WOLFBRIGADE and PISSCHRIST in Milwaukee (epic evening, seriously) and it was fukkn magic. Really, it was. I have toured with a lot of bands...good bands, and good people...and I have had a really good time with most of them. But the bands I have really connected with? I can count them on one hand. LA FRACTION lives on that hand. I could talk about the 450+ mile drive east from Missoula (no stops...my longest stretch to date) with Magali sitting shotgun. I could talk about D\u00e9d\u00e9 showing up in Leipzig and making John and me snort soap (that happened). I could tell a lot of stories that are now a fucking decade old, but my point is that this band is special, and if you have yet to discover them...then today is going to be a very special day for you. Similar to the day I looked up at the Gilman stage and saw that bright red shirt and wondered what band would make a red shirt with an (even/already in 2002) outdated Photoshop 101 image plastered on the front. What band? LA FRACTION. They are from Paris.....and they are (still) fucking beautiful. \u00a0 LA FRACTION This tape was released by Nikt Nic Nie Wie, and contains LA FRACTION's debut LP from 1998 and their EP from 1996. Twenty years cannot dull the power of these songs.... http://lafraction.org/ http://www.nnnw.pl/index_e.html"

And when you're setting up in a sweltering warehouse to play for a cowd of maybe half a dozen people...? Doom gets real real hard. That was the scenario facing Tijuana's ABYSSAL afew weeks ago in Fresno, and I was one of the \"maybe half a dozen\" in attendance. They got their shit dialed in and calmly announced 'We're going to play one long song for you\" and then embarked on an absolutely epic journey of sound. You could hear a pin drop in that warehouse during the introduction...and then came the tonnage. This is the hard part - because doom is (to a large extent a formula) and the audience often knows what's coming, the artist needs to surprise the listener with the how more than the what. And when ABYSSAL got heavy that night, we weren't surprised as much as we were completely blown away. It was hot, the room was awkward, and the band was mesmerizing....doom might be hard, but that night it was as if there was nothing else in this world more important than doom. It was perfect, and listening to A Deep Sea Funeral will always take me back there.\u00a0A DEEP SEA FUNERAL https://abyssaltj.bandcamp.com/music"

No big deal, but we had a stupidly large array of shirts and needed to spread out, so we set up our veritable shopping mall on the other side of the room with our pals/tourmates ASSHOLE PARADEand proceeded to have a quite excellent evening. As we were on our way out, a one of the guitarists from EX-FRIENDS walked up to me with a scrawled note wrapped around a tape. Dude gave me a sick demo, but couldn't come to the show because \"work sucks\" (feel your pain, buddy). The vaguely interesting part is that he put it in the merch area, where no one from our band set foot all night, and since the outside of the small package read \"Terminal Escape,\" it's only because someone got nosy and read the note that the tape ever made it to me... and I'm glad it did. SHADOW LAUGHTER play earnest UK82 styled hardcore punk with vocals that seem to be trying to break out of '80s US hardcore shouts with only occasional success. This sounds like a teenage band in all of the best ways - the drummer is trying so desperately (check out the lurching start to \"Living In Fear,\" it's pure ramshackle bliss), and though the songs are relatively simple, the way SHADOW LAUGHTER attack them is fukkn great (and on a side note, they have the coolest name I've heard in ages).

A lot of cool bands, bands people were excited about for various reasons - some justified and some superficial. The show was a killer; eight bands, I was on my way home before 11pm, and even the worst band I saw that night was pretty damn good. But there was a band from Iowa on the show that no one was talking about, a band who only a handful of people seemed interested in, a band that wasn't wearing cool punk uniforms...a band that absolutely leveled the joint. I've babbled about NERV here before, and I was quite excited to see them live, but I was fukkn floored and couldn't wipe the smile off my face. Simply put: This is what I want from hardcore! Bare bones, completely honest almost to the point of self deprecation, fast as shit and songs that grab you and force you to engage. Heavy on the '80s Midwest hardcore influence (I'm talking Touch & Go, early Chicago), this is raw and completely unpretentious with manic jams that seem to give zero fukks about current rehash trends and knuckle dragging Oi! riffs repackaged as hardcore (a trend that I fully back, for the record). Listen to the drums hesitate and lurch into the full speed strained vocal attack of \"Bug,\" the single note riffing that starts \"Shut-In,\" the guitar break in \"Dig A Hole\"...these dudes so casually pack so much power into eight minutes that it's kinda unreal. Their new single is every bit as good as I hoped it would be. And for the record, the rest of the show was really fukkn good and I had a blast, but no one touched NERV that night.\u00a0 I don't know who I am // I don't know where I stand NERV 3 Find NERV and other shockingly good sounds from Iowa here.

Seeing WARHEAD in 2001 must have been absolutely terrifying - they sound like a bulldozer churning dead earth. Dark fucking hardcore with dual vocals and some of the fiercest two chord riffs I've ever heard - early GEHENNA energy fronted by a deadly high/low vocal assault. It's worth repeated listens to deconstruct the assault, but doing so only exposes what you already know - WARHEAD are about the fukkn fight.\u00a0THIS IS A PROPAGANDA"

The vocals are a touch whiny and the recording kinda blows, but there's a charm to rudimentary hardcore punk delivered with an enthusiasm unhindered by cool points and the internet. And \"Sometimes I Feel\" shines well brighter than any technical insufficiencies, think GRAY MATTER as teenagers. Pretty sure these tracks come from their second demo in 1988, but I could be wring. THAT'S NOT SLAM DANCING...IT'S A MASSACRE!

They switched members with class, making their changes during the set so that the (then) new personnel finished the show. And cooler than the fact that they remained shit hot fire during every move was the camaraderie with which everything happened - like the \"old\" was just kinda passing the thing on and offering support. Like they were all still family. I'm not going to get into the male vocals on this demo vs. Jenny's vocals in the current lineup, because it really is still the same band and both singers are fukkn devastating so win/win. Fierce, urgent hardcore, not at all contrived, and a spirit that owes ever so slightly to early '00s political-meets-posi hardcore that flooded the scene (and speaking of that era, Moses nails the new millennium fastcore drums better than anyone I've watched in ages). They aren't a new band anymore, but PROVOKE are at the center of a new crew of hardcore in the Bay Area that is getting me (re)stoked.\u00a0 PROVOKE https://provokehc.bandcamp.com/album/fragments"

Is it pure nostalgia for an era of music (and community, and activism) that so many of us simply weren't around (or alive) for? Are the sounds on their own simply enough to pull in listeners from the future? Are we intrigued by the rarity and the mystique? Or is it that we want to see ourselves in these bursts of pure and desperate energy....and we want to think of ourselves as visionaries like we think they were? Or maybe we just fucking love punk. And when someone tells me about a punk band from Wales who recorded only one batch of songs in 1981, I get fukkn excited. They don't need to be the best songs I've ever heard....because they are new songs and I'm hearing them for the first time. And maybe \"Do We Need This\" is barely listenable on this tape and maybe \"Fight For Freedom\" isn't even on here at all but holding a piece of 40 year old punk is still cool as shit.\u00a0All of the cuts here have appeared on compilations, though mostly not until the Bullsheep Detector series on AntiSociety came out in the '10s.

Sarah was more than a guitarist, was more than just a mere inspiration, and even though we didn't see each other often there was an instant void. I can see the absence on the faces of friends feeling the same thing. When Sarah did things, she did them right. No fanfare, no flag waving, no celebration - just quiet determination and pure conviction. That is her influence, and to me that is her legacy. The records are great (seriously, all of them), but the impact is so much more personal and so much more intense than a few good riffs...even when the riffs are as good as these. It's the genuine look in her eyes that tells you that everything matters, that you matter, and that what you do is important and to never stop fighting. And to never stop smiling, though I confess that one is pretty tough to pull off today. While her musical legacy is primarily associated with her life spent as Mike Kirsch, Sarah's personal legacy transcends both gender and sound. Few people in the world of DIY hardcore have been as influential, even as important as Sarah. It's an impact I honestly doubt she was fully aware of, and a level of genuine respect attained by only the most worthy...these are the things we should say to our friends while they are alive, but rarely do. Never stop fighting. TORCHES TO ROME I've found myself deflated by the years defending this life led idle and we've seen the loss too many times. This life is bought and sold, the days I've dealt with blinded by the numbers piled up high beside me. They try and keep me pacified but I find you're happy and satisfied. No will or way will ever bind me to this burden to keep dissension at bay. And every day I fight myself, tried and tired but moving forward. Where do we go from here?

Moody, driven rock music of the highest caliber that would have fit in nicely in my early '90s rotation before I fell hopelessly down the hardcore rabbit hole. This banger is from 2014, and I recommend their subsequent releases just as highly. WORRY LINES https://soggycreep.bandcamp.com/"

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on March 05, 2019 Description from Terminal Escape: SUNNY SPENCER's decision making leaves a bit to be desired on his 1977 cassette, starting off with the almost 6 minute burner \"Mama Don't Allow It\" and following with \"Just A Little Closer Walk With Thee,\" a track that slows things down before they ever gained momentum. The context of the opener is important, as it was a standard during Spencer's time with SONS OF THE PIONEERS and featured him making the rounds and playing essentially every instrument in the band during the track....however that doesn't really translate to the recorded medium. But Spencer's Mama Don't Allow (presented as a self titled release in cassette form) nonetheless hits all the bases the way you would expect from a recording made ten years earlier. His version of \"San Antonio Rose\" is endearing and innocent, his \"Night Life\" is perhaps artificially bluesy, but the dude is clearly reaching for the stars (or stardom itself) and that in itself is to be applauded. The clarinet makes frequent appearances, harkening (intentionally, I'm sure) thoughts of BOB WILLS and company as well as the Pioneers, and the piano swings in opposition to both the Nashville Sound of the '60s and the various interpretations of Outlaw Country Musical Liberation that dominated the airwaves by the time Spencer recorded this one in Vancouver, Washington (same place Willie cut his first record, in case you're keeping track). Perhaps as much a footnote or a casual obscurity as an important document, this punk still a spot in his heart for independent C&W, even (or especially) if it was only independent out of necessity.

NINETEEN NINETY SK8 ***A dude from DIME STORE HOOD/WHEELBITE named Adam (or Alan....? shit) mailed me this tape after we hung out once sometime around the turn of the century. Super nice fellow who I enjoyed meeting, and the tape was packaged much more elaborately than this simple cover scan implies. In 2009 I went to see LOGIC PROBLEM at a bar in SF called Pissed Off Pete's and I got shit ass wasted. Was debating puking in cab, puking on the bus or walking and hoping I could stay awake and on my feet long enough to make it home. The bright lights of the 14 Mission made my decision for me and I stumbled aboard. Adam (or Alan...? shit) was sitting right next to me and I really wish that I had been able to carry on a conversation. Even remembering someone from that long ago is not exactly my strong suit (massive understatement), but it would have been cool to actually have a conversation.

An energy that's simply hard to find in a lot of the squirmy post-mysterious guy stomps of the modern era. I like those stomps, but this record (presented here in cassette for, naturally) just fukkn rages. And sometimes that's actually what I need.

Number Two is easier to get your ears around though...until it isn't. A few tracks of deeply damaged hardcore punk with FLIPPER by way of early '00s DIY punk energy. \"1989\" opens with starts and stops and tweaked guitars and it's almost like EDDY CURRENT mingling with STRAIGHTJACKET NATION (to keep the referenced country-specific). And then....well, and then SHIT FETISH starts to deliver. A raw and punishing hardcore dirge, and mid tempo meat swerve, a piece called \"Slakto\" that almost hits like some '60 fuzz rock until it takes a turn and I don't even know what kind of freedom I'm listening to anymore. There's just one cut left, and SHIT FETISH saved the.....best? for last with \"Nasty Boy.\" The recording itself has gotten progressively weirder by this point in the tape, and the guitars are something entirely foreign and unrecognizable which is perfect because this is where the FLIPPER really starts to come out. And then comes the electronics and it all just falls the fuck apart and I'm just sitting here looking at my cat.

Oorwormer is an essential 1982 anarcho/post punk comp from Holland, and some well meaning punk rocker presented her/his copy with a homemade cover and some crafty editing (the VERZ ED tracks are \"Shit, so not on this tape\" - though I think that the space time continuum limitations of a 90 minute tape might have been a factor as well, as this comp clocks in just under the 45 minute mark without the VERZ ED songs, so I can only imagine the extra effort required to make a cool cover and a cohesive package with two songs crammed onto the SV\u00c4TSOX Ruins side of the cassette - that's the record taped onto the other side of this shell, naturally it will appear here soon...making tapes is tough work, kids - way harder than crafting a playlist). Two songs each from 13 different seminal Dutch acts, B-SOCIAL and RED ORCHESTRA are my least favorites, though on their own they are still stellar, which let's you know a bit about the exceptionally high level of quality on this comp. NV DE ADEREN turn in two scorchers and might be the punkest act here in the traditional sense, the brilliant INDEX, angular addictions from ZOWISO, dirty melancholy burners from GRRR (fukkn love the guitars), and female fronted bass driven sounds from ASBEST that remind me inexplicably of THE CURE's early recordings. THE EX turn in their expected quality, and the comp rounds out with ATIMS, ZWEMBADEN, HANGDOGS, and \u00a0SV\u00c4TSOX - if anyone has a copy of this comp lying around gathering dust, I assure you I will give it a good home.

On the one hand, my time management skills leave a fair bit to be desired - which is to say that I love to spend a day (or more) putting a ripping tape together, but there are very likely many things that I should be doing instead. On the other hand, when one does not give, then one may not receive. And slammers like the fifth volume\u00a0Broken Teeth in the mailbox is surely a compelling argument in favor of making more mix tapes and diving back into The Exchange. These are the quandaries that consume me, dear reader: Should I make more mix tapes or should I not make more mix tapes?

But Ottawa's COUNTDOWN TO OBLIVION were all of the great things about crushing late '90s hardcore crammed into one insanely good band that left us with a criminally small recorded output, so I will do my best. Ripping metallic shred (as in \"Poster Children For Family Values\"), screaming dual vocal proto-fastcore (\"No Brainer\") and amalgamations of that decade's crushing hardcore/crust-by-way-of-DIY-basement-hardcore (most of the rest of the tape) sound brilliant to my new millennium ears. This is for the tools who still waste breath stammering about how '90s hardcore was shit...COUNTDOWN TO OBLIVION might have dropped this near the end of the decade, but the years are seeping out of their very pores.

I almost identified with them in the broad context of metal, but there were so many more things going on that I did not understand. In retrospect, SUBSANITY were on the cusp of the heavy hardcore/metal/crust that was infiltrating DIY punk at the time, but of course I knew nothing about that...(I just came to the show because this dude I knew who was into ballet said the band he was in was playing a show). And my mind was blown. Two singers, a bassist who looked like a fucking monster, and an aural assault that was like nothing I had ever seen or heard before. Listening to these tracks years later, these dudes were way ahead of their time (especially considering their geographical handicap), and the shit sounds just as urgent in future decades as they intended at the time. They were always teetering between a trainwreck and total brilliance when I saw them live, and these songs in my ears today help me realize that my initial impression was pretty much spot on. I know that SUBSANITY changed lineups over the years more than a few times, and vocalist Mike can shed more light onto their history than I ever could (he was one of the earliest followers/comment leavers here, so mayhaps he will?), but even today there are songs on this informationless cassette that will melt your fukkn face.

With no time or space for bullshit or filler, they bulldoze through a brooding intro that morphs into the verse, then a chorus with a ridiculously infectious guitar hook and lay multi gendered vocals into the mix with an adolescent enthusiasm that belies the years lurking under their respective hats. Every song is great, in my opinion...moody and serious punk that is fun to listen to in the same manner that shamelessly addictive pop tunes become inadvertent summer anthems. Unpretentious and casual, but still completely serious. When Farofa slips the leads in on guitar (take \"Working,\" for example), it's like a jolt of electricity, and the way his vocals mingle with Mila's is just fucking right. The beats are simple, but listen to the way the booming intro to \"Doomed Forever\" switches gears and propels the band to the end of the tape. The shit is right, kids. Sometimes you don't need it to melt your face....sometimes you want it to sink into your pores, because then it becomes a part of you. IN THE BEGINNING THERE WAS...

Dub Ditch Picnic has been an under the radar favorite at TEHQ for several years, the kind of label that makes you feel comfortable parting with your dollars in exchange for new sounds because the imprint on the shell was a symbol of quality. Of confidence. The engine behind the label was Chris Jaques, who passed away at the tender age of 50 back in April....the catalog is still available digitally, the catalog is recommended, Jaques' efforts are (still) appreciated, and I'm still going to scoop up Dub Ditch Picnic releases whenever I come across them. As for AURA LEVEL FOUNTAIN....it's the sound of a fitting sendoff, honestly. Light and gentle sonic breath with a distant but determined ominous undertone. Three tracks that span nearly one hour. Sounds that you want to settle into and get comfortable....but sounds that will keep you on edge. Paying attention. Because even the beautiful sounds are warnings.\u00a0TULAN TUALN AXCANPA https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/search?q=dub+ditch https://dubditchpicnic.bandcamp.com/"

Solidaridad is a collection of EP and comp tracks all recorded in the late '90s, including their side of one of their two splits with RENUENCIA, which is their rawest (and best, to my ears) material.

Raw and hollow hardcore from Tennessee played with absolute fury and determination - clean guitars that are tortured more than played, and vocals that are more in line with the by product of a backwoods exorcism. There are two demos in today's download, the most recent features 18 songs and clocks in at well under 16 minutes, while the 2011 slab blazes through 14 tracks in less than 9. There are hooks buried in that chaos and it's hard to tell if the distortion is by design or necessity, but the result is so gloriously twisted that I don't care. There's another demo available here, and I suspect that after jamming these songs into your holes you will be clamoring for more.

And then there are bands like Austria's RUIDOSA INMUNIDICIA. In the eight years since this demo (which was committed to wax by Way Back When a few years ago), they have managed only 2 EPs and a split full length, but each of these releases is nothing short of mandatory for fans of fast hardcore punk. Searing female vocals in Spanish (the band is from Austria, but the singer is Chilean) front an all out assault that leans ever so slightly on melody while never once sacrificing intensity. The emphasis is on fast and the result is stellar, all of this band's recordings make me yearn to see them live. Someday, perhaps. RUIDOSA INMUNDICIA HeartFirst still have copies of their 2010 EP, and you can snag the split with SOLID DECLINE from Residue.

In other words: this shit rules and would arguably be just as good if there was no reverb on the vocals and the guitarist didn't have a phaser pedal. \"No Uniform\" is so gorgeously relentless, and the drum fill that starts at 0:45?

DEMO 2013 When looking on the internets for some interesting fodder related to this tape (I do that for your benefit...you're welcome) I hit the fukkn motherload. Apparently some dude from MERCENARY is the son of Kevin Kinney from DRIVIN' N CRYIN'\u00a0who I feel like I saw in Norman, Oklahoma about twice a year while I lived there (and I remember them being insanely loud) and who I still jam from time to time. But what's even weirder is that Scavenger Of Death bothered to mention the Kevin Kinney connection because he was in the seminal Milwaukee band THE PROSECUTORS, whose EP is an absolute stunner and impossible to find. Scavenger Of Death reissued that record this past summer (probably because they are bros with the dude from MERCENARY whose dad was, like, in a really rad punk band a long time ago). Anyway, shit is weird so listen to this superb tape today and then order yourself a hard copy while you are getting that PROSECUTORS single, which is really good. You need it. Seriously.

Raw, forceful fastcore/PV with brief excursions into epic crust, the echo and effects are on the backing vocals (and it makes them sound massive) while the leads are just distorted by pure power and remind me of AKEPHAL even though the band doesn't (so really, that is a rather stupid \"comparison,\" eh?). The whole thing lasts twelve minutes, but these Greek warriors cram an awful lot of power into those minutes, and I look forward to hearing more.

My head was spinning - I'd just spent three winter months with Karoline, and we had decided that she was going to relocate to the west coast and we were going to get married after only knowing each other for a few months...maybe it's easier for some ideas to seem wise when you are younger, but even blinded by young love there was an element of Chevy-Chase-about-to-jump-in-the-pool, Vacation styled \"this is crazy this is crazy this is crazy\" shit going on in my brain as I headed home. Many hours into the journey while chilling in the back of the Greyhound listening to my walkman and trying to ignore everyone, a vaguely punk looking dude asked me where I was headed. \"San Francisco,\" I replied. \"Cool, I'm going back to Oakland...you want a snort?\" I thought (hoped) he was offering me drugs, but he (fortunately) just had a flask of whiskey and we proceeded to get quietly tipsy on the back of the bus for a few days. It was an eventful trip - stranded in a freak spring blizzard in a Wyoming hotel (technically, all of the passengers slept in the lobby because Greyhound wouldn't get us rooms), a dude getting into a physical altercation with the driver (for drinking, ironically...he clearly wasn't as stealth as we were) outside of Elko, Nevada and getting kicked off the bus in the middle of nowhere. We didn't really talk much, but I realize now that he would have had tons of stories to share, and probably could have accelerated my introduction to east bay punk by several years....but we just chilled, drank, and took comfort in knowing that we weren't the only freaks on the bus. I never saw the dude after he got off in Oakland and I continued across the bridge...and nine months later he was dead. It wasn't until the summer of 1998 when Karoline and I went to his memorial show in Oakland to see FILTH, EXODUS and GRIMPLE play in his honor that I realized what a huge force Lucky was. While it might be easy to dismiss this as a weird memorial post for a guy I didn't really know who died almost twenty years ago, let it be known that these tunes are fukkn sick. From the opening EBMUD track that sounds like a more punk WIPERS to the raw hardcore of NO DOGS, Lucky's output is stunning. Like a bridge from classic '80's punk/hardcore to the sound that made the East Bay famous, these bands are full of hooks and have enough teeth to rip your fukkn heart out. Relentless hardcore from FOR PEACE and NO DOGS are the clear faves for my ears, but THE LEFTOVERS, EBMUD (though, seriously, how can \"Confused\" be so undeniably brilliant and \"Fly Into The Sky\" be so really bad?), CRUMMY MUSICIANS and especially STOP THEM DOGS are classic blasts from '90s Oakland - melody and frustration combining forces to make timeless tunes. Most people outside of this area would probably never have crossed paths with any of these sounds, and thankfully Eggplant did a brilliant job of compiling and sequencing this comp to let us all know what exactly it was that we missed. Also and not for nothing: the interview clip from the Green Day tour is the best thing you will listen to all day. I can think of few better ways for someone to remember me after I'm gone than a snippet like this one. Later, dude...thanks for the whiskey.

But y'all don't look at that shit so I'm gonna put it on The Main Stage. The title says it all, pretty much: on a November evening in 1986, there was a pretty stunning gig at Skate-A-Rama in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and it was captured by someone in the audience. The recording is thin, and pretty rough in places, but it's all there...and it rules. Only three tracks from the FACE FIRST set (including \"Little Man\" from their near perfect self titled EP) who were on fire at that show. Four blasts of high energy CRYPTIC SLAUGHTER-esque thrash from R.I.P., possibly the only recording of this band that survived the decade. But of course you're still reading this because of the headliner. Tulsa's N.O.T.A. are easily Oklahoma's most notable hardcore export, and they are so fucking fast here that it hurts. Recorded just before they split up (the first time) with a lineup that featured Dave Scum (who had been associated with or friends with the band for years) on vocals while Jeff played guitar. Original guitarist Russel had left the band by this point and they had a replacement bassist as well, so it's a maybe a bit of a scab version of N.O.T.A., but holy shit this set is fast. Scum's vocals give tracks like \"Police Front\" a kick in the ass, and some of the shit is so fast it's barely recognizable....a studio recording with this lineup would have been a welcome gift to late '80s hardcore. Six cuts, interrupted by a fight. Because of course.\u00a0LIVE AT SKATE-A-RAMA https://escapeisterminal.blogspot.com/"

I miss shows, but I think that most of us do, so why the fuck do you need me to remind you? That said, I miss the fuck out of record stores. Hanging out in them, rapping with the employees or other diggers. Shit is fun, even if I don't leave with any nuggets. There's a store in Oakland called Contact....I like it there. Folks there hipped me to LES FILLES DE ILLIGHAHAD, bought a killer KEIJI HAINO record for cheap once, it's outside of my regular routine, but that just made it a little treat when I stopped by. Contact curated the Astral Maps mix I posted a few years ago, so I was understandably juiced when Spencer let me hold onto this Pop Magic tape put together by the same team. The title is the descriptor, and its accurate. There's an unsurprising emphasis on folk nuggets that bridge generational and genre gaps (AIRBUS, DWIGHT TWILLEY, CHRISTIE, FARGO), with some bonafide slammers from established winners like SHIVVERS, AUTOMATICS, POPPEES, 2 TIMERS). If the radio was like this, we'd never listen to records (unless we needed a hot grindcore injection, of course), and extra hails for the GERRY RAFFERTY cut chosen as the closer. Now, I need Ack Ack Ack #1 if anyone's holding.\u00a0\u00a0POP MAGIC https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2017/12/astral-maps-country-rock-68-73.html"

Primitive industrial noise struggling to bury haunting black metal ambiance backed by a distorted vocal attack that makes you feel like you are standing in a blinding snowstorm, submitting to the elements. The rhythm starts around the four minute mark, a premature death knell that only builds upon the foundation built by everything that came before...this shit is enveloping, and creepy as hell.\u00a0 A STRING DETACHED //4.bp.blogspot.com/-HWelfXW-crk/VWcFch39Y2I/AAAAAAAAMVY/MxLXkNWzaG0/s1600/thoabath%2Bimg%2Bcopy.jpg http://thoabath.bandcamp.com/releases //3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZO06VaMEy2g/VWcFahXsDhI/AAAAAAAAMVQ/83fCmL8Vc3A/s1600/thoabath%2Bcover%2Bcopy.jpg"

Three Japanese exchange students playing ruthless and only vaguely competent grindcore backed by three more women the band had enslaved to serve as dancers/roadies. There were different outfits (made by the band) at each show, and the spectacle of this crew of tiny women rolling in wearing pink dresses and laughing at their own ridiculous jokes that didn't make any sense to anyone else, and then leveling the joint with pure and genuine noise-not-music for twenty minute....well, it was pretty great. The thing was, even though they were presented as a novelty act (the members were from the planet Puchin Pring, and their space ship broke down, stranding them on Planet Earth, and they started a band and released and EP to raise money to fix their space ship and return home to fight the evil Madam Cactus, who was trying to destroy their planet.....so, yeah) with choreographed dances,\u00a0the lyrics were legitimately serious and the band was legitimately intense to see live.\u00a0 LITTLE PRINCESS were short lived (I was fortunate to participate in their final show as a guest member), but GERI LIVE! were right on their heels. Most of the same women, this time dressed in black. This time playing with more ferocity. This time they looked evil as shit with Noto serving as an uncompromising frontwoman. This time they were serious and this was no fukkn novelty. Except that...geri means diarrhea,\u00a0and all of the songs were about shit. \"White Lover.\" \"Angry Ass.\" \"Poop Swimming.\" Finally this crew had honed their craft...and they just sang about poo. And of course we fukkn loved it, because it was fukkn great. They made an EP with a GAUZE ripoff cover, you should probably find it. I seriously miss 1999 sometimes.\u00a0 GERI LIVE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R-ru1IM5Dc&list=PLF18F205B10B05216"

Guitar sounds drawn from '80s avant/post/art punk, shrill vocal squeals that land somewhere between MELT BANANA, BRATMOBILE and OLD SKULL are dropped with precision over drunken lurches masked as songs...and it all works. But it's weird as shit. The longest track on the demo, \"Transitions Into Victory,\" features the most damaged sounds coming out of a guitar while the drums and bass lay back with an early '80s Rough Trade groove and the vocals start to get a soulful swagger, but that's as close as TEENAGE WAISTBAND get to anything normal on this 2011 release...and they make sure to wipe that impression clean with the tape's closer \"Ghost In The Boombox.\" This one took be by surprise.

The keyboard solo on the first song is where Italy's WISTERIA really settle in and the chorus that follows has even more presence and power than the band did earlier in the song, setting the stage for a b-side track that will knock you out of your boots.

I left a bandmate's wedding reception early to catch them in a backyard in Oakland last summer (sorry, Andrew), and while the sound was complete garbage and I couldn't see a fukkn thing because the lights were pointed at the meager audience....they leveled the joint. I bought a stupid Chainsaw Massacre ripoff tour shirt (little known fact: sometimes I don't make the best financial decisions) and this banger here that easily makes up for the cash I blew on that shirt. As the title (and art) suggests, here's Sweden's PARANOID laying waste to a who's who of modern and classic punk and metal: PISSCHR\u00cfST, EXPLOITED, STREBERS, CELTIC FROST, SEPULTURA, KAAOS, DARKTHRONE, STATE OF FEAR, ACURSED (most underrated Swedish band of the '00s?

You can see what you missed here, and start making plans for next year, or you can just take my word that this weekend has been a much needed shot in the arm for me. Great band after great band, and lots of faces I haven't seen in far too long...punk stuff can be very good, my friends. I got a few records (including the NO FORM 12\" - holy balls I hope this band makes it to our shores), a few tapes that you'll be hearing soon enough, and today the weekend closes with a 924 Gilman show with Bay Area freaks SBSM (and a bunch of other bands). This four songer was released last year by FOTE Remote Outposts, and I was pretty floored to hear that their live mania was able to be harnessed onto magnetic tape. Soaring electronics, layers of vocals, hypnotic drums pounding out appropriately monotonous rhythms...good shit.

The opener \"Worker\" is a disorganized cacophony, followed by \"Farmer,\" which is an intentionally sloppy piece of brutality - awkward to listen to but also the least realized track on the tape. The trilogy that follows - \"Polishing Hammers,\" \"A New Trade\" and \"Unidentify You\" - combine to make the most compelling twenty minutes of sound I have heard in a very very long time. It's a ferocious exercise in monotony and deliberation, a calculated assault on all senses and psyche, and it will leave you breathless.

The opening chords of \"Divided\" on 1987's Too Much Pain sound like HICKEY playing AC/DC, and the riff that follows is a hardcore scorcher that would be at home in the N.O.T.A. catalog...and then\u00a0the dudes launch into a primitive thrash metal assault that absolutely must be heard. The demo is a straight killer from start to finish - tracks like \"Out For Yourself\" manage to combine DC hardcore circa '81 with Bay Area thrash circa '83 and it's all so brilliantly raw and untainted by success or money...and \"Victim\" will smoke any of the other tracks on the as-yet-unreleased Bloodstains Across Upstate New York comp (I'm talking to you, Biff, these fools were from Elmira). In addition to the Too Much Pain tape, this post includes the notably rawer Why? and Nothing For Nothing\u00a0demos, both from 1986 (the latter is a life affirming exercise in rough, primal hardcore/thrash). These sounds are pure, just listen to the vocals that come in over the end of the solo in \"Shattered Silence\" and you'll surely agree that it's the gnarliest shit this side of VOID, even if the band thought they were playing thrash metal. If the rest of Alex's bag is as good as this shit, then we are all in for some insanely crucial jams.

Overt shades of early '90s dream pop awash in guitars, Hungary's PIRESIAN BEACH were nice enough to include tracks from several vinyl and digital releases on one cassette for our convenience. Channel PRIMITIVES, MAZZY STAR, JESUS & MARY CHAIN, VASELINES, blips of PJ HARVEY, TSUNAMI, MBV, all tempered with a brilliant Nuggets filter. I could get lost dissecting the construction and the presentation of tracks, the nuances that differentiate the recordings, but ultimately this band just nails everything they try to do, and I support it completely.

We quickly reached an unfortunate conclusion: our geographical region suffers from a severe lack of crust. It's too easy to take crust for granted, perhaps because poor-to-average crust bands are a dime a dozen, but there's never a bad time for a dirty downtuned DBeat churn with metallic guitars and fist in the air breakdowns...that's what we wanted. But fear not, \"lack\" does not mean \"absence,\" and EXTRACTION are holding things down until proper equilibrium returns. Clenched fists, lots of hair, screaming (but short) leads, and tracks that get in make their presence known with force, then get out. Just seven tracks, Dead And Buried clocks in under eleven minutes and ends with a perfect chug in \"Hidden.\" When Will and I were talking a few months ago, EXTRACTION exactly what we wanted...and wanted more of.\u00a0 EXTRACTION https://extractionmetalpunk.bandcamp.com/"

Two doses of precision punk that learn from the lessons of the masters without plagiarizing, it's a truly perfect punk single and I cannot recommend it enough....but this blog is (still) about tapes, and ROTARY CLUB crammed some of their magic into a little red plastic shell last year and I just can not get enough of this shit. You're going to hear folks throw around the KBD tag a lot and I'm certainly not going to disagree even though it doesn't tell the whole story. This shit is thick and sassy and it swings like nothing I've heard in forever, but it also hits hard and the songs are a master class in punk song craft. Like....what if KARP did a record on DANGERHOUSE in 1979? Think for a minute about how that might feel, because ROTARY CLUB do it like that. Then consider that all of the lyrics are land line telephone themed and you have something (a band? a project? ...a movement?) that's only scratching the surface of something great.\u00a0HUNG UP ON RITUAL https://ironlungrecords.bandcamp.com/album/american-tower-lungs-223"

In hindsight, my only complaint is that I didn't get to see LOW CULTURE play that night, and hopefully there will be a repeat performance so we can fix that.

Information indicates that this is a two person project, though the drums could just as easily be recorded by (and as) machines to take the temperature down even further...and allow STAKE to exist wholly in one person's mind. And home. A desperation in the sound pleads for the interaction that many are now lacking, a coldness that walls off the warmth of human touch. At its roots, STAKE sound like a vaguely danceable dark punk band - but there's something special about a band when they hit you just right. I ripped this one at the very beginning of the journey into The New Reality, not knowing where the journey would lead or what the reality would be. Six weeks later....we still don't. And while I don't think the humans responsible for STAKE are prescient, somehow I feel like I will hear them on the other side.

As far as I can tell, Worceter's ALIENATION were a blip in late 1980s UK punk - when wild thrash and ugly stench were taking over the grooves and the anarcho punks were...well, simply not making as many interesting records as they had been just a few years prior. Greatest Hits (1987) is a band who might be trying for commercial success - kinda dark wave and/or post punk but their shot lands somewhere between endearing and off target (check the vocals in the verses of \"Live A Lie 'Til You Die\" and let's cringe along together). There are great moments here, and this vision taken to its ultimate potential could have been something special (\"Vicious Circle\" in particular). What ALIENATION did after that however is truly special - on 1988's Yeah, That'll Do they lose the bass and really hone their approach. Vocals are less in front of the mix but more controlled (read: more intense) and the guitar work is abrasive and overbearing; it's like they just decided to cut all of the bullshit and created urgent punk with a deep and frustrating edge.

Like, that pretty much sums it up. Every individual element was simultaneously stuck in its own world, buried in its own process, and still they were acting together like a fucking machine. The singer had a sport coat and a briefcase for seemingly no reason whatsoever, and was a freak of nature on stage. Their breakdowns made you want to lose control completely, except that you didn't want to miss whatever FANCY was gonna do next. I feel like there probably weren't that many people watching (it was early), but that might be because I spent their entire set having a moment - I was in my own world as much as the people on stage were, dragging myself into the present periodically, just to exchange \"holy shit, this is happening\" looks with Karoline in the form of \"Kill Everything\" smiles stretched from ear to ear. This fire was a disease, and it was infectious. If you do nothing else of consequence today, crank \"What You Got?\" - listen to it loud and listen to it repeatedly.

The approach has more in common with '90s SXE/metalcore (before tech crap completely took over) - the sixth track is a perfect example of dumbed down (and slowed down) metal riffing delivered with crew vocals that seem to be shouting \"Skinhead, Skinhead, Headskin, Headskin\"...and it rules.

When something goes wrong or someone needs help, they just seem to say \"let's do a benefit.\" And as easy as it can be to dismiss this allocation of financial and personal resources (seriously, it's really easy), it's just as important to recognize the common struggle and speak in a unified voice....even if that voice is straining to be heard over screaming guitars. This compilation was released to raise money for and awareness of refugee Camp de la Lini\u00e9re in Dunkerque, France during what was then the most heart wrenching public refugee crisis of my adult life. That crisis has now faded into the shadows, shrouded by packed nationless boats in the Mediterranean and unforgivable crimes against family and humanity at the US/Mexican border. So, do we need another compilation cassette? Maybe not, but it helps to know you're not alone in your thoughts....and maybe it will help you know that you aren't alone in your actions.\u00a0 DBEAT THE BORDERS It's worth noting that this comp fukkn screams from start to finish.

On the one hand, fans of MANKIND?, DISRUPT, RESIST and associated outfits will need no convincing - power is power and context be damned. On the other hand, think about Belarus in the 1990s as the USSR disintegrated and left a void simultaneously filled by Lukashenko's fist and HATE TO STATE. The sociopolitical realities of activist punk in regions with access to \"western\" influences while hamstrung by the limitations (and oppressions) of \"eastern\" governments is a piece for a different time (and a different writer), but it puts \"Cold, Hunger, Wind, Death\" in a different context than if it\u00a0was some band from Michigan, you know? Who noticed HATE TO STATE? That's a deeper question, but I'm just here to remind you that it happened...and that it was fucking powerful.\u00a0 This regurgitated copy (on the flip side of the YOUR KINGDOM IS DOOMED tape) has the full demo plus nineteen uncredited tracks from two different sessions without femme vocalist Stasya - the recording on these song is more punk and less hardcore, but the second vocals are definitely missed).

OK, maybe there are a LOT of those times, and maybe there's more output that sinks in that canyon than lands squarely on either side of it, BUT my point is that often I am not sure if I enjoy something because it's actually and objectively good (or even just interesting), or because I've been duped. I'm not the sharpest knife, and I'm pretty easy to get over on (especially when you're talking about something so completely outside of my typical wheelhouse), so maybe you throw a bunch of reverb on some ticking clocks and crumple paper next to a contact microphone and call it music and maybe I believe you. Or at least this is what I was thinking a few minutes into \"Lacking A Cast Shadow,\" the opening track of 2008's Graduating From Clocks To Watches. There's no rhyme rhythm or real reason, it's just a collection of sounds, and there's no art to that, right? There's no skill to that....right? But, I thought, what if I like it anyway? What if the innocent monotony of \"The Broken Windows Of A Fertile World\" actually seems kinda gorgeous, even if there's really nothing to it, and what if that is actually the point? What if that first song really was just ticking clocks and tearing paper and what if that was the message? I mean, surely this release falls into that aforementioned canyon somewhere, and maybe it never even makes its way out of the abyss, but listening to the chaotic crescendo that closes 13+ minutes of \"The Self Is An Onion-Self\" to end this release I once again decide that I don't care. And that I will listen again and not make judgements. That I will just absorb, and the result becomes the meaning itself.\u00a0 GRADUATING FROM CLOCKS TO WATCHES: EUREKA TAPES vol.II https://goateaterarts.bandcamp.com/"

It's entirely possible that he's actually making tortured and drug addled depression sound like bedroom pop, but that gets into some cause/effect discussion that's better reserved for another venue. Released at the start of 2018, Negative Highlight Reel is among the more advanced of Repulski's 20+ releases - drum machine pop hides behind a shroud of experimental aural assemblages, a series of collages that blur the lines between presentations and/or actualities. The recording closes with a proto-raga that barely holds after the brief Ranaldo/Shields/Rev-esque wash of \"Kimp Notch\" fades away, and it leaves me with a yearning for more that I have rarely experienced - I was anxious that it was over because it was all gone too soon. And the anxiety of absence can describe much of the approach here, and overwhelming feeling of want that GRAHAM REPULSKI has been able to consistently deliver over almost a decade of (intense) productivity.\u00a0 NEGATIVE HIGHLIGHT REEL https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2LA62zvwxbY/XjmDgFXAZjI/AAAAAAAAWiY/Q-RceIF3AuAIZWqI1Rhk7xvxpKkQLApzACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Graham%2Bfront%2Bcopy.jpg https://grahamrepulski.bandcamp.com/music"

ANSIEDAD There are a bunch of other things that generally rule and include, but are certainly not limited to:\u00a0 1) This RAYOS X tape (vocals are way more strained and the whole thing is more blown out than previous efforts...going backwards suits the band well) 2) The POLISKITZO set I saw tonight (seriously, just.....yes) 3) The fact that last night I saw T.S.O.L. in the year 2014 (Grisham wore a sport coat, was a general douche, and seemed like he would rather be doing stand up comedy - and while the band was legit, I bet his stand up comedy would be better) 4) Punk (never mind the fact that a dude told me last night that his old punk vest was being sold in New York for $2K+ at some fashion place...just fuck people looking like punks that aren't. I mean, I have essentially never looked like a punk but I am, which is exactly why: fuck people who look like punks that aren't. Punk is not cool, that's the whole fukkn point. There were 30 people at the show tonight and it ruled. That's the whole goddamned point) 5) This tape. //1.bp.blogspot.com/-QaMZmXU5uyU/U3cQrJLR5sI/AAAAAAAAJ9s/ZqqpQQREiZQ/s1600/rayos+x+cover+copy.jpg //1.bp.blogspot.com/-01Uxk_fy7KA/U3cRJDlho0I/AAAAAAAAJ90/0rDlqHwYxYo/s1600/rayos+x+img.jpg http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2012/punk-chaos-to-couture"

There were a couple of shorter jaunts that came first, but in '94 we embarked on a truly ridiculous nine week journey with nothing in tow but a demo no one wanted and some really ugly shirts. We played with LAGWAGON on a native reservation in Arizona, we played with DEFIANCE at ABC No Rio, we played with AVAIL in a high school gym in Iowa and we played with TOTAL CHAOS in Mankato, Minnesota. We played an arcade in Albion, Nebraska and the office of a used car dealership outside of Albuquerque. We listened to BORN AGAINST and PROPAGANDHI constantly, and slept on picnic tables at rest stops because we had nowhere else to go and unironically called it \"camping.\" The whole thing was full of future memories permanently etched into my mind, but I think my bandmates would agree that the highlight of the tour (at least in the \"memorable experiences\" category) was the Spiderfest in Marmora, Ontario (population 1,500 or so). A regionally legendary fest by that point, Spiderfest was held on the estate of an old dude named Spider who was punk as shit and didn't give half a shit what anyone did on his property (I believe that 1995 was the last year that paramedics were allowed at his alcohol fueled drug/punk fest in the woods, eventually leading to the authorities shutting the fest down). We rolled into town clueless and a couple of townies directed us to Spiderland Acres for a weekend of confusing debauchery...several hundred people fukkd up as all hell wandering around the woods...and there were some bands too. I am sure that most of the bands were complete shit, but BLOWHARD, ARMED AND HAMMERED, POLITIKILL INCORRECT, SHITFIT and the leather kilt wearing MC (named Thor?) made an impression that has lasted two decades....and then there were VAGABONDS from Montreal. Snotty UK influenced bar punk that might not mean shit to me if I heard it today but, at 21 years old and a million miles away from anything I had ever seen or done before, these haggard (read: drunk) dudes cranked out some perfect party tunes. And the drummer was so incredibly annihilated one morning on the path from where we were parked to the stage that we thought he might be dead. There was this grimace frozen on his face that I could not possibly describe, and even after he woke up, that grimace was there for the rest of the weekend.\u00a0 FROM AUTUMN TO FALL Imagine my surprise when a quick internet search revealed that punks STILL put on a Spiderfest in Ontario (footage from 2012 here...about like I remember, but with way less people). Spider died in 2009 at the age of 72. //2.bp.blogspot.com/--3lymDxQM4Y/UfBqDQXOfGI/AAAAAAAAIRQ/_czHFD0lvj0/s1600/vagabonds+cover+copy.jpg //2.bp.blogspot.com/-7__rREZsDm8/UfCRCHDW93I/AAAAAAAAIRg/qAlNQeccRPI/s1600/vagabonds+copy.jpg //1.bp.blogspot.com/-lrrk-7KVKPE/UfCRHXTzazI/AAAAAAAAIRo/dvmI5UTyINQ/s1600/vagabonds+img+copy.jpg //www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcJqBGtuhr0&list=TLO5FqH9tuF_k"

Low fidelity is one thing, but Brooklyn's VORDE have drowned legitimately advanced black metal in a murky sea of washed out cymbals, guitars in a seemingly endless struggle with the mid range white hiss that constantly wants to take the lead role. But thankfully the songs win the battle, and the scene set by the aural presentation is a genuinely haunting one that benefits the band in the end. Droning, morose vocals and plodding drums give way to howling blasts and whatever nuance VORDE might have lurking far beyond the shadows...the overall presentation is a desperate wash of power and desperation, and I genuinely fear what might happen when this band progresses beyond the \"demo\" stage. The internet gets excited because the drummer for this band was in FELL VOICES, though personally I am more juiced hearing that the dude was in MOHORAM ATTA and the mighty RESIN HITS - but never mind \"former members of\" lists, this is raw North American Black Metal at its finest.

There version of a breakdown is the weird quiet blast beat at the end of \"Neutrinos,\" and the riffs throughout will make you cock your head to the side like \"what did I just hear?\" the same way that a lot of us felt the first time the German metalcore of the same era fell into our ears.

This cassette listens like a lost anarcho gem - drum/vocal political rants assailing the artificial female hormone industry, poetic presentations addressing inequity and death backed by nothing more than the sound of rain, minimal synth, and a slew of angular punk tracks that may be a bastard descendant of night of passion between Bullshit Detector and Punk And Disorderly -\u00a0all created and assembled by Shannon St. Ryan, an exceptionally nice (and, quite honestly, interesting) fellow who has been involved bands and recordings as varied as PHOBIA, STRUNG OUT, IN CONTROL and NAKED AGGRESSION. The fifteen tracks here take up just over half an hour and run the spectrum, filling genre defying holes as they veer in and out of compartmentalized punk and making this a wholly listenable and engaging cassette in the process.\u00a0 I can only imagine that there are (or could have been?) countless more hours of this creative manifestation, but it appears that this untitled (unreleased?) demo and a split EP with PUS are the only physical documents available for public consumption.

These re not the sounds I turn to, but I'll be damned if they aren't so good at the thing - this is what I wanted in high school, even though it didn't exist yet. Guitars are appropriately fuzzed out and sound massive, vocals swoon in a way that you are only supposed to hear on the radio, and it's like they take everything that is so easy to make fun of and make it good.

Not many outfits pull off something truly original, something that sounds like them, and one listen to 2004's Flashing Open makes it clear that PLASTIC CRIMEWAVE SOUND were accomplishing this feat right out of the gate. Plenty of PINK FLOYD, plenty of fuzzed out acid rock, but I get an overwhelming feeling of honesty when I listen...nothing contrived. The Oblivion Programme is from 2013, and shows these Chicago freeks driving a little faster and hitting a little harder at times, but they no less blissed out, and the shoegaze set could learn a few lessons from tracks like \"Mother Sidewalk.\"\u00a0 THE OBLIVION PROGRAMME https://plasticcrimewavesound.bandcamp.com/album/flashing-open"

Mesmerizing goth/industrial sounds from an obvious punk background....'Lucy\" is a JOY DIVISION dirge fronted by a born male Siouxsie while the tape's opening track, \"Keep Those Stones Up Boys,\" features a terrifyingly confident frontman belting out arguably pretentious missives over droning, reverb drenched, melancholic guitars dragging a drum machine through the misty night. The closer falls in line with the opener, \"Anchorites Of The Night\" is slightly more upbeat (but still dreary as all hell) while \"Hell Fuck\" embarks on a goth tinged industrial punk journey the likes of which you have never heard. The pace is frustrating throughout, and the effect is certainly intentional. The result is that I need more, because this is perfect.

The second track leads me to believe that these kids (might have) had punk roots, but then the chorus drops and it's just brilliant outsider pop.

And Sally transfers that kind of deliberate intensity into MULTA KNOX...an artist that forces you to give all of your energy if you want to reap all of the rewards. Living Pearl - as a casual listen, as background sounds - is excellent. It fills the room and provides a perfect diversion.

But if you want more, if you are willing to give yourself to these forty minutes the way those minutes deserve, then you will be rewarded.

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on February 29, 2016 Description from Terminal Escape: When I first moved to San Francisco in the mid '90s, it took a while to develop a social circle. Most weekends were spent with John and Matt snorting speed, listening to that MENSCLUB disc on Bar/None (Side Note, punks:\u00a0this one is pure fire and motherfukkr creamed the drums like few fools I've ever witnessed), and talking about our band - I didn't really know anyone else, and this is a hard place to meet people. Eventually we started to fall in with a solid crew with whom we shared familiar common denominators like music and drugs...and that's where we met a dude named Steve. My memory says Steve played in TINA, AGE 13 (for the purists and historical perfectionists: the internet says this is not so), but perhaps Steve played in CORDUROY (?),\u00a0and Steve definitely lived at 109 Cypress (I mean...probably? I might be wrong here. He definitely did drugs there). 109 was a weird and dark place where I spent many mid mornings out of my fukkn mind...it was also a place inhabited and frequented by a bunch of fukkn geniuses. Steve played drums for FUCKFACE when we played a set of HICKEY covers for Tania's birthday party (that was the night HICKEY played a set of SABBATH covers as surf instrumentals - a legendary night in my brain) and was an all around solid dude who was always...all around. I honestly do not know how I came by this tape, and I didn't know that these sounds even existed until recently, but I can't say that I'm surprised. Equal parts '90s Mission, VASELINES and DINOSAUR, this collection of recordings is an actual portal into genius unrealized (or underutilized?). The combination of brilliance, innocence and freedom is a hard one to fuck with.

Meet Cafe zine released this tape in late 1983, a collection of mostly Vancouver/Victoria bands with HATES (Houston) and FATAL EXISTENCE (Pennsylvania) representing the USA. Most (all?) of the Canadians were new to me, and digitally connecting the dots led me to not just RED TIDE, DEAD END, MERE MORTALS, BILL OF RIGHTS and IMMORAL MAJORITY, but a whole cadre of associated bands that registered barely a blip on the radar at the time, but quietly left some crucial early '80s punk in their wake. Other represented acts are POLKAHOLICS (\"Zap The Universe\" is a perfect dose of synth/freak punk), SILENT MINORITY and TOMATARAMA, and there is genuinely not a bad song to be found in the mix so I'm not gonna start picking favorites. You just have to keep digging, because I don't ever think you'll get to the bottom.

The synths in \"Different Universe\" assault with painstaking simplicity while beats methodically lure you towards the mournful pounds of a lone stringed instrument...a space age death march you can witness only with your ears. \"Less Future\" follows with a terrifyingly subdued drone interrupted by desperate clicks and minute swells from keyboards that have already resigned. All MUTANT VIDEO works are excellent, but they have absolutely outdone themselves on this release. Not to be outdone, the HOUNDED WOUNDS track on the flip is superb. A nine minute crescendo that starts with distant CLOCK DVA styled electronic sounds, enters into sinister late '80s industrial/dance for a few minutes and then spends the final three minutes pummeling the listener with hideous white noise flowing in waves and leaving me as helpless as the terrified electronic screams that soar over the top of the madness. It's hard to decide whether this leaves me hungry or just simply dumbfounded.

Take elements of late '80s Polish punk that flirted with new wave (REPUBLICA, the SIEKIERA full length) and somehow fit it into the small handful of mid '00s indie bands that did it right (guilty pleasures like INTERPOL, FRANZ FERDINAND, even bits of BLOC PARTY), and then put it all in the hands of punks. The results are before you...and the results are astounding.

You hear Corey's bass ruble in the break that starts \"This Life\" and you just fukkn know. It's a churn, and it all rushes by you in a blur that forces you to search for the nuance - it's there, but you might be to busy breaking everything and questioning life itself to stop and listen for it.

His presence as a musician and a personality is impossible to overstate, and he will be missed terribly. MISCHIEF BREW played Berkeley last summer, and Karoline and I were for some stupid reason \"too busy\" or \"too tired\" to make it to the show. Whatever the excuse was, it seems beyond foolish today as I think about the gracious and understanding response from Erik when I wrote to say we wouldn't be seeing him....my heart goes out to my Philadelphia friends, and especially for Denise (and the pugs!). FIGHT DIRTY Shared several years ago on The Escape, this 2009 collaboration between Erik and GUIGNOL is one of my favorite MISCHIEF BREW related releases (though The Stone Operation probably takes the cake).\u00a0 At countless SUBHUMANS and CITIZEN FISH gigs over the years (we first crossed paths on the first SUBHUMANS reunion tour in 1998), Erik would talk about how he hoped he would get to see CULTURE SHOCK someday. Not only did he see them, but he shared the stage for \"Civilization Street,\" a track famously covered by Erik over the years. I saw this video for the first time a few hours before Karoline called me from the CULTURE SHOCK tour to tell me about Erik's death. I watched the video several more times that evening. Mimicking Dick's hand and arm motions at the 0:22 mark...still makes me smile, even with tears in my eyes.\u00a0 Philadelphia, 2011 photo: Nick Vadala MISCHIEF BREW https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hGAyponhPZA/V41Qw4TwjSI/AAAAAAAAPWk/Holj2E19jhEB1BAqUNvOWfa9vIvNiRxKgCLcB/s1600/Fight%2BDirty%2B1.jpg https://mischiefbrew.bandcamp.com/album/the-stone-operation https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3WaRLtZdfCA/V41S2cy3aVI/AAAAAAAAPWw/4Lg14o_HKBsMW9TD485V4A1nPvt4EJPdACLcB/s1600/Erik_5.jpg http://www.mischiefbrew.com/"

Didn't learn about the aryan shit until later...live and learn, I suppose). I made a few random purchases, shots in the dark, and most were forgettable (though I have a KVIST disc that has lasted several purges). Then WEAKLING were just the new metal band in town and Aesop lived down the hall and played all kinds of shit and some of it was good and some of it was stupid but all of it was different than the German metalcore I was probably immersing myself in at the time. The point is: I don't know that much, but THIS sounds like all of the good stuff that made me think that this subgenre was worth delving deeper into. And sometimes when you delve deeper, you find bands like Norway's HELVETESPINE. Harsh, bleak, plodding raw black metal in the tradition of the first wave of Nordic heavyweights. Maybe someone else will tell me that these sounds are unworthy for one reason or another, but I think you will find that this 2007 release is more than capable of making your skin crawl. Guitar solo at the 4:22 mark of \"Helvetespine del I\" is a particularly grim moment....let yourself sink in.

The vocals are unparalleled, and they somehow stick tenderness into music that is so relentlessly intense that I'm convinced that any hint of sensitivity must be an accident. This three track demo was released for their tour a few months back (obviously), and I wish I could tell you to listen to it and think of happy summer times...but this thing is every bit as bleak as the winter. It's hard to believe that the enthusiastic fastcore kid I stayed with in Phoenix on tour in 2004 has turned into the beast that is even partially responsible for this filth...

I can't really decide if it's just the vocals that drive me batshit, or if I find the whole thing unlistenable (update: it's the former - the guitar tone is killer, and some of the songs are decent in an endearing and/or nostalgic way), but really these are the kind of historical artifacts that give credence to the argument that the '90s sucked. Sure, they're kinda fast sometimes, and there was nothing wrong with aping RANCID from time to time (it was 1997, and I'm pretty sure these kids had at least two GRIMPLE records between them), but ultimately this demo just sounds stale. Dated. Unnecessary. So riddle me this: Why do I keep listening? And the honest answer: Because I like it. Sigh.

Whisper In Darkness had dropped a couple of SPECTRES 45s before this 2009 demo was released (and one of the first AF releases was a split with SPECTRES, so the scene comparison can't be completely off...), but I feel like early ARCTIC FLOWERS recordings and especially their live shows blazed a trail for minions of goth influenced dark punk bands. And the difference is/was the punk aspect of those bands - it certainly isn't/wasn't new for crusters to toy with brooding new wave or to celebrate Eldritch and JOY DIVISION, but ARCTIC FLOWERS live performances built a bridge (or tunnel?) and countless DIY bands flooded in throughout the aughts. Shamelessly honoring the past by injecting new life, it's as if the '80s are just lurking menacingly in the crevices of their debut; songs like \"Technicolor Haze\" that would go on to be re-recorded and remixed many times over subsequent years present themselves here as a foundation, especially in retrospect, for a huge wave of punk bonded by an approach more than any specific sound. Maybe it was really just time and place and maybe this all happened organically and these punks just happened to be there...or maybe ARCTIC FLOWERS just let everyone know it was OK.\u00a0 ARCTIC FLOWERS"

And the xylophone solo totally makes sense, which is even weirder. IVES reminds me of those (almost punk sounding) early Norwegian black metal bands I heard in Aesop's room in 1995, which I think is their point. Not that IVES know who I am or that I lived in Aesop's room, but that they would like to sound like those seminal bands...except for the first few seconds of the title track where they would like to sound like MITB (super weird, but compared to a xylophone solo, not really that shocking).

I thought I did a pretty good job making everything flow, then got to the end of Side B and perfectly timed the remaining space to a weird CHARLIE TWEDDLE track (as any tape maker knows all too well, timing the end of each side is key, and we always keep an arsenal of short, poignant numbers up our sleeves for mometnts just like these). Boom. It was about to be done. So I dropped the needle, I unpaused the recording and I went to pop open a celebratory beer...because a good mix tape is an accomplishment worth celebrating. And then an enemy known only as \"auto-reverse\" reared its head, and before I knew it, the first 10 minutes of the Side A had been replaced with the gentle crackle of a needle knocking at the matrix...fuck. Normally, I could have just recreated the first few selections, but I had started this particular mix with a self-edit of PHAROAH SANDERS' \"The Creator Has A Master Plan\" (a controversial tape making tool, but one I am comfortable utilizing when appropriate) and it would be impossible to nail that timing again...so I started over. Many of the same tracks found their way back into the program, but offerings by SCREAMING TREES, PTARMIGAN and BEHAVIOR didn't seem as appropriate to the overall vibe and were replaced with WAYNE NEWTON, THE BODY and BRUCE GILBERT. I am very pleased with the tape, and have listened to it many times since (re)completion. While it brings me pleasure to share this here, and I hope that it brings you pleasure also...nothing can compare to the feeling of packing up a tape to mail to someone far away. Imagining it reaching their hands and then filling their ears...it's why we do this. And sometimes it's our very reason for existence.\u00a0 11.11.16 https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CnNZnp572pM/WDRroICZGSI/AAAAAAAAQDo/1YETCD4lJH4fAiv4sqIpBUdhWLubpz0gQCLcB/s1600/11%2B11%2B16%2Bimg.jpg"

Their pedigree made people perk up (REPLICA, HUNTING PARTY, NO BABIES) and with good reason, but fukk there were so many fukkn popping up and popping in and popping out and just poppin' that it was easy to skip one unintentionally here and there.

CAGES combine transfixing noise/soundscapes with haunting female vocals that urge comparisons to an older, more resigned and sadder DIAMANDA GALAS. The music on this tape is garnered from various live performances in Buffalo, New York during 2006-08, and they often take on an ambient quality - while \"Psalm To Mother\" is an inwardly violent and cacophonous piece, the tracks that follow spend more time in the background than they do in your conscious aural field. \"Burial\" can sometimes slip completely by me when I listen to Anti-Realist (I think this is my favorite song on the tape, it just requires...demands...undivided and intense attention), and I'm jarred back to a harsh reality by \"Cavern\" to close the release. The harshness of CAGES is shrouded by their calm but erratic exterior - far from a crew of artsy noisemakers, emotion and turmoil permeate these songs. To listen to CAGES and not feel something is to simply not feel, and if that is the case then I feel for you...or maybe you just need to listen harder. And louder, these songs are better at maximum volume. ANTI REALIST Released in early 2011 by D\u00f6d Universe, purveyor of many fine slabs of thought provoking noise. //3.bp.blogspot.com/-TtarBqDj5yc/Ti4MDZN2AWI/AAAAAAAABzA/Yj0ElW6elzQ/s1600/cages+cover+copy.jpg //2.bp.blogspot.com/-YNupx5TWMgI/Ti52LMc7fyI/AAAAAAAABzE/UOvoCkb62Tw/s1600/cages+spine+copy.jpg http://soundofadeaduniverse.blogspot.com/"

The first cut sounds like it could be the introduction to an unknown prog band's set, and from there the duo flirts with primitive electronics (John Pfeiffer, Nic Raicevic) and space age soundtrack fodder. Everything is sparse, light...and freeing. The entire recording listens like a casual, but nonetheless-just-barely-missed, connection, and I'm left feeling unbothered and pleasant. What if all sound could have such an effect....?

AD NAUSEUM, however, were the real deal. The first of several cassette releases, 1982's self titled demo is an assault of inept anarcho punk delivered with raw and pure desperation, fighting through tape hiss and a guitar pegged to the right, tracks like \"What A State\" bang two riffs back and forth like a manic pinball machine. Most of the tape is made up of rudimentary slogs, a verse chorus verse chorus verse chorus stop structure repeated song after song, teenage punk at it's absolute finest. Like I said...you can't make this shit up, and when it's real you know it.\u00a0 AD NAUSEUM The tape includes a ten song session (I have to assume this is a rehearsal recording, because if they paid someone for this then they are either really drunk or really foolish), followed by a 19 song set from March of 1982....as if to prove that the ramshackle performance captured on tape is, in fact, really what AD NAUSEUM delivers. I shared this one a few years back, but after a few loud listens last week and the realization that many pre-2013 links have long passed into the digital ether (yes, I know...no, I won't/can't fix/replace them all) it seemed that a revisit was a good idea.

Devoid of a clear focus or direction or sphere of influence, ALTERNATIVE SECTIONS seem to take what they know, what they like and what they want and use the collective force to just BE. Valuable more as a sociological artifact than a listening experience, 1993's Thoughts Of A Broken Image is sometimes carnival punk, sometimes \u00a1TCHKUNG! styled freak sounds, sometimes Midwestern college reggae, sometimes well-past-its-prime alt/goth/shock rock....and most of the time I spend not enjoying the sounds (which is, let's be honest here, most of the time involved) is spent wondering at them. They shine when they stay quiet, when they stay dark and mysterious, when they focus on the keys and not on the layers of percussion, and when the shrill, nasaly vocals are not front and center...but the whole point is that they just sound like themselves, and that's what is cool. Musical communication is almost always contrived in one way or another, but before those lines of communication were so clearly developed and so readily available, \"artists\" seemed to have more freedom to go their own way....and those relics are welcome in any form.\u00a0 THOUGHTS OF A BROKEN IMAGE"

An oppressive wash of monotony closes in on all sides which reduces competing sounds, musical or abrasive, to little more than auditory hallucinations fighting for legitimacy through a fog. Then the first track comes to an end, and BLACK HAT begins the real journey. Two pieces of primitive and minimal subdued electronics followed by \"Lattice and Coromant,\" a brilliantly tweaked high energy dance track - you've heard of \"taking drugs to make make music for people to take drugs to?\" That track is quite possibly the very embodiment of that methodology, and the execution is mesmerizing. The tape closes out with five more minutes of chilled electro-drone and a stunning proto-industrial piece titled \"Singing Point,\" and I want nothing more upon the conclusion of Covalence than another listen. I want to submit completely to these sounds.

The pures might claim that hardcore was dead by 1987, and the self righteous might claim that nothing worthwhile happened after 1985 (incorrect), but there are so many underrated bands that popped up in that weird spacial void between punk's 1980s heyday and the birth of the DIY network in the 1990s. Not quite linked to the anarcho scene, removed from early hardcore, but playing by a rulebook that seemed to allow them to get away with whatever they wanted, these bands often appear to exist in an ether devoid of scene association...which is what makes them so appealing. BLACK OVER RED approach tuneful punk with the fury of the UK thrash that popped up around the same time, and it just manifests fiery punk.

It's not like when we were kids, when you sought out The New Thing and it stayed the new thing for days or weeks or months and you drilled it into your head because it was new and exciting (and you probably only had like 25 records to listen to anyway). But now...? Everything is quite literally at your fingertips, so music needs to be special to have that kind of staying power. The resurgence of synths and pseudo electronic experimentalists has resulted in countless artists who have learned to toy with sound without remembering how to focus their scope, much less construct a song. Some, however, are looking intently at paths forged by the pioneers...and they are paying attention.

Saw BAD BRAINS in '81. Saw SSD, DEEP WOUND, NEGATIVE FX, all the shit. Bought all the records when they were new for like $2 and is still a record collector so still has them all. Moved to San Francisco in time to see the wild heyday of SF hardcore - THE FUCK UPS w/AGNOSTIC FRONT, The Mab, B.A.S.H. violence, heroin pretty much lopping the whole damn thing off at the legs. And then around '84, he started listening to and collecting jazz. Kept the punk records but ditched the punk in favor of SUN RA and CHARLES TAYLOR. You talk to him about punk and he seems almost surprised that the genre continued after he lost interest. My point? Well, when the stadium crust kids shifted gears and started playing DISORDER influenced noise punk in 2009, do you think that stadium crust just....stopped? Of course not. Likewise with the second generation noise punk kids who started scooping up BAUHAUS and CHRISTIAN DEATH records and giving bleak brooding punk a worthy resurrection in the early '10s.....while the third generation noise punk kids held fast in the shadows with their shoelace headbands. Just because you aren't listening (anymore), doesn't mean it's not happening. And somewhere, someone is just as juiced as you used to be - and their excitement is no less relevant, no less intense, and no less important than yours was. Which all has virtually nothing to do with Portland's BURIALS except that I feel like I would have succumbed to the waves of these sounds had they washed over me in 2004 or so - I get the same feeling I had when I saw BARONESS in a Milwaukee basement in front of eight slackjawed attendees. I don't really listen to much music \"like this\" anymore, and technical guitar work tends to leave me flat....but The Tide is a storm, and BURIALS are completely in it. While you're expanding horizons, check the split with EXHAUSTED PRAYER on End Theory\u00a0(more atmospheric death metal, less technical).

I openly bow at the altar of many of their other projects (CROSS BREAKER, DRUJ, FUCKHEADS, PRIMAL BRAIN, CRUTCH\u00a0and others) but they thought I would hate this band. Even with that context, I wasn't prepared for what happened when I popped in Forgetting To Sleep, Dreaming To Forget - it's amazing. To be clear, it's not going to be a thing that I listen to with any frequency, but there's no rational way to avoid acknowledging that it's great. Radio ready commercial pop punk a la fellow Oklahomans ALL AMERICAN REJECTS, with a killer GBV cover to close out the tape.\u00a0 I figured it would be good based solely on the responsible parties, but I really\u00a0 didn't know what I was getting into.

Quintessential epic crust...riffs for days, a constant low end heavy chug, and a singer with a rasp well worthy of the Northwest elite. If nothing else, HIVE stands out for the intensity and speed they bring to the game - even the slower, more melodic bits (\"Reversal Of Fortune\") will have you clenched tight...the knife edge that this band straddles creates a legitimate tension with even a casual listen. Comparisons aren't really necessary, but if you monkeys like the sound of a black clad apocalypse with full stacks, then here you go.

Nowhere near straight forward enough to be death metal, way too metal to appeal to Japanese hardcore purists, and too innovative for anything approaching mainstream attention. Watching them live was like watching an earth mover destroy a playground, casually sucking all of the sugar coating out of life and leaving you with reality, and recorded is no different. On my list of top shows ever: HELLCHILD, DS-13, ARTIMUS PYLE and DDX13 in Joe's Garage outside of Reno in 2000. Not a bad gig at all, and watching Scottzy smoke meth in the loft while convincing a teenage mall punk girl that he was a bad influence and that it would be a bad idea for her to get in the van that was parked across the street...in front of a playground and in broad daylight? That was pretty funny. Only two songs here, and no recording information - just an endorsement and an anecdote. HELLCHILD\u00a0"

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on May 11, 2018 Description from Terminal Escape: In the summer of 1994, my band MULTIPLE CHOICE embarked on a ridiculous nine week North American tour during which we lost all of our money and most of our dignity....and during which we made friends that I still cherish today. One of the last shows of that tour was in San Jose with ALL YOU CAN EAT (who were at that point, at least to newcomers like us, already stalwarts of the Bay Area Scene - they had toured overseas and members worked for Maximum Rocknroll for fukks sake!) and Boise, Idaho band HAGGIS (who had something cool written on the side of their van, even though I can't remember what it was). It was classic early DIY touring - the dude who \"set up the show\" showed up late and all the bands just hung out on the sidewalk with some local punks in front of the venue in downtown San Jose until he got there...and we told him the venue was locked. Turns out he hadn't exactly asked anyone if he could do the show there, he was just kinda hoping they would be open or some shit, so we convinced him (or guilt tripped him) to find a house where we could have the show. Wait....did I say house? I meant apartment - like in an apartment complex. So even though it seemed we were gonna play mostly for each other (you want to romanticize touring, young punks? because playing for the other bands at the show because no one knows who you are and no one bothered to stop watching tv to come see you play....? that's what touring is really about)\u00a0but we double parked and were all working like a team to load shit in to this apartment and set up in the living room. And then a cop drove by as we were pulling the bass cabinet out of the van and he stopped and he looked at us as if to say \"what the actual fukk do you think you are doing?\" and we all kinda assessed the situation and thought \"yeah, this shit ain't never gonna fly\" and so we loaded the gear back in the van/s. So yeah...that's how I met HAGGIS, and that's how I became friends with ALL YOU CAN EAT.\u00a0 SL9 demo But if you want to listen to this 1996 demo, and you should, then you are in for a fukkn treat. I mean, if you like melodic 1990s punk. But the good kind....not the mindless generic bullshit. Guitars that bridge a gap between Flip Your Wig and early '90s Bay Area (note: original HAGGIS guitarist was ex-SEPTIC DEATH...according to The Internet), and the kind of gravel drenched vocals that make the era so easy to apologize for. I asked Karoline for comparisons and she mentioned CRIMPSHRINE and SCHLONG and JAWBREAKER and Hayes-era Lookout! and I don't disagree with her at all even though I have completely different reference points (like: DEAD MILKMEN playing high energy pop punk through 1985 H\u00dcSKER D\u00dc's gear without changing the settings). The main thing though, is that SL9 holds up extremely well in the face of an overly judgmental and/or compartmentalized internet. These songs are absolute burners - and if you can sing along and there's a story to go with them....? Well then that's even better.\u00a0"

Started to post it more than once, but the words never seemed right so I opted for something easier. GAS CHAMBER is not easy, not simple. GAS CHAMBER is deep, visceral, and intense beyond words. This year's Hemorrhaging Light LP on Iron Lung defies description, it is a revolutionary collection of sound that transcends mere hardcore music. So it should not be surprising that this cassette collection that was released before the LP, a series of interludes, compositions (and one banging single), is a total stunner. The two pieces that make up \"Prone\" set the stage for the remainder of Kairos Will Erase, prolonged ambience exploding into massive bursts of advanced hardcore. Goosebump inducing vocals and bass flanged to oblivion, driving the recording (indeed the whole band) through treacherous twists that would have most outfits stumbling over their own fingers. For me, this tape is all about the noise... \"IX\" and \"X\" take up over 25 minutes, and it's that sparse, anxious intermission that makes this presentation of the Corpse With Levity EP (presented here in the same form as the vinyl release) seem wholly different than the first time I listened to it cold. The list of bands that can make so many different sounds and styles all feel like they belong is very short, and this band is at the top. Trying to describe the music is hard enough...but describing the power is impossible. Without question, GAS CHAMBER are among the most intense live bands I have ever seen, but this tape will hold you over until you become one of the The Fortunate Ones.

GUERNICA Y LUNO are charging, passionate hardcore - hints of metallic influence in the guitars and and brilliantly forceful vocals. JANUSZ REICHEL played in ZIMA during the late '80s, but these tracks are haunting psychedelic folk weirdness, acoustic guitars and layered vocals work together to create a mood that is hard to shake even after the tape is over.

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on June 16, 2013 Description from Terminal Escape: New York's JUNGLE BROTHERS and England's FREESTYLERS, both snagged off of BBC radio in 1998. JUNGLE BROTHERS pioneered the marriage of rap with house music in the late '80s and their set features music, interviews and tracks like \"I'm Gonna Do You\" that will remind you how to have fun. The last half of their airtime gets a little more rowdy and a lot faster (naturally this stuff is more to my liking). While JUNGLE BROTHERS were veterans when these broadcasts were made, FREESTYLERS were in their infancy - the internet tells me that their sound is called breakbeat, whatever the fuck that means, but I hear retro '80s freestyle (a style of dance music I can only identify in the most amateurish manner and even that is only because of B and Boo Boo) meshed with whatever kind of music URBAN DANCE SQUAD played in 1988. I'm pretty sure I've driven away anyone who comes here looking for punk, so I'll take this moment to add that FREESTYLERS version of \"Breakers Revenge\" is an absolute dancefloor crusher. 17 minutes from FREESTYLERS, 27 from JUNGLE BROTHERS, all offered in authentic moderate fidelity recorded on a teenager's boombox-in-the-bedroom-late-at-night-while-parents-are-sleeping sound.

I've seen JACK WITH KILLER's name for years, but only heard the band recently...my loss. Two demos in today's download (you win, punk), the five song ripper pictured above and the decidedly more noisy and off the wall sounding Black Sheep. This shit is unconventional and struggles to color inside of accepted hardcore lines (I would argue that while the Black Sheep demo fails at staying inside of the lines, it succeeds at being awesome). Totally off the wall early '90s Japanese hardcore, not even remotely cool...which is exactly why you should like it.

GRIMPLE's Up Your Ass LP is so perfect (an make no mistake, it IS perfect) because it is super pissed, lightning fast and catchy as hell. Before pop punk was universally revered as a bad word/s, bands like 9 IRON loved getting schwasted on shitty malt liquor and playing fast and loud...and they loved GREEN DAY too. And that was OK. In fact, it resulted in some really great recordings. Dated, but still great. This band popped up just when I left Oklahoma, and I don't honestly remember if I ever saw them or not (I want to think they played one of the two Mission PunkFest gigs at 17th & Capp, but I might be confusing them with BOB OF TRIBES, who were on tour with BROTHER INFERIOR at the time....), but I know I played the shit out of this rough and snotty demo for a few years before it found its way into a box. Fortunately, it also found its way back out. 9 IRON"

A collection of killer tunes is great, of course, and the track is the obviously the foundation for great hardcore records....but sometimes nothing can touch popping in (or dropping into) a recording and losing yourself, emerging 15 or 45 minutes later feeling like you've just been somewhere. Sometimes hardcore can do that (and those ore the great one, naturally), but I feel like you'll find the real masters making this happen in other realms. DIVINE INTERVENTION are perhaps both. A black metal ZOLAR-X reinterpreting Levitation, mayhaps. It's a mind melter, it's drawn out noise/psych jams with buzzsaw guitar, it's CHROME for a new reality, it's five supremely damaged and unrecognizable pop songs broken up by casual interludes to give you time to breathe.

Before this 1988 tape, they had added a B (Brendan) a second guitarist (John - hard to squeeze a J-word into that name, I guess), and they were a suburban hardcore machine. From the three second SABBATH rip that starts \"The Struggle,\" you can just tell you're about to get leveled...and you are. Pissed, slightly metallic US hardcore punk with the laid back second wave groove that allowed bands to construct songs (often to their own detriment - some bands are just built for speed). Every track here is a classic - from the guitars that open \"Cause Of Death\" to the chorus of \"Crematorium\" C.B.D.S. punch way above their weight from start to finish. Brad's vocals deliver a forceful and slightly awkward youthful warble that brings to mind early '80s Orange County punks while the band bashes out \"Afraid\" with confidence and power...afraid of nothing. There was a rehearsal tape before this recording, and a decidedly more crossover demo that came after - all are worth visiting, and all are worth far more praise than the band receives.\u00a0C.B.D.S.And the \"other\" CLEVELAND BOUND DEATH SENTENCE? Check the logo and the aesthetic on their 1997 EP, and know that one of the founding members spend a lot of time in Milwaukee in the late '80s and early '90s. You're welcome to draw your own conclusions.\u00a0"

Turn of the decade freak music, but I'm talking about the '80s --> '90s here, when funk permeated seemingly everything and the hardest punks were turning into college art rock grown ups (or maybe they were simply \"growing up\"). New York City's W.O.O. seem to fit nowhere on either of those spectra. A weird cover of Sinatra's \"Boots\" makes me wonder what it would sound like it YEAH YEAH YEAHS made the same move 25 years later. \"Reno\" is a(n almost) psychobilly burner. And those tracks are sandwiched between two doses of IDIOT FLESH style prog/funk, \"No Hurry\" is pretty weird while \"Big Picture\" could have found a home on the Homestead roster. I mean, this was happening in NYC while TRAGIC MULATTO were playing shows in SF, so I guess it's not that weird. You just have to listen with 1989 ears instead of 2021 ears...which is probably how you should listen to most things, just to be safe.\u00a0W.O.O. https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kje5kUBk7rU/YP90Fpp2fHI/AAAAAAAAZxA/9KxZ9xkvqMEmzvxLkH3zJiCz-kuJfPV4wCLcBGAsYHQ/s804/WOO%2Bspine.jpg"

FURY OF A THOUSAND ZEUSES released one EP in ridiculously low quantities right after I moved to Milwaukee in 2002, and this demo was a sweet find after wearing the grooves of that slab down until they were paper thin. Chaotic and brilliantly crafted Midwest hardcore punk steeped in the tradition of the region and reared on alcohol and speed, catchy as shit with brilliant guitars buried once again under an appropriately shitty recording. This tape is bizarrely still available, probably because Eric gets wasted and makes copies on a boom box in his bedroom: ericapnea(at)hotmail(dot)com. THE BOOS // FURY OF A THOUSAND ZEUSES Today is the start of the Riverwest 24, one of the single greatest events of which I've ever been a part (and I am, to be fair, but a very small part). A total test of endurance for riders and volunteers alike, this year shapes up to be even more insane that last, and I can't wait for the 7:00CST start. Expect more Milwaukee sounds tomorrow to continue my appreciation for my old home. //3.bp.blogspot.com/-Rsa9Xre0z4E/Ti7fopriWAI/AAAAAAAABzY/FxdquzeoTFs/s1600/boos+FKZ+split+cover+copy.jpg http://www.riverwest24.com/"

FUCKFACE played a really weird show in Nogales in 1996 - massive stage so tall that attendees had to stand thirty feet back just to see the bands. One four channel vocal PA to power guitars, vocals and a wholly unnecessary snare drum mic. Don't remember who played (hell, it might have been LA MERMA), but I traded one of our shirts with a neighborhood dude on the street for the shirt off his back - a weird skull and the name of the town twisted into a crude Metallica logo that read\u00a0NOGALES - Where Shit Happens. We didn't get into any shit that night, but I wore that shirt for fukkn years.

Six bands are featured on this tape, recorded in 1992 at Narusis in the northern suburbs of Tokyo (technically it's Saitama, but you can get there on a fukkn JR line, so it's pretty much Tokyo, right?). Raw hardcore from MAU MAU and BAD TASTE (the latter is faster...and probably the best shit on the tape), and rudimentary (and endearing) melodic punk from STRAW DOGS. DOWN BY LAW were the only band I was familiar with before I heard Always Next, and their tracks are screamers with an enviable guitar tone, while 5 MINUTES and REFRESHING JACKUP play gritty, bouncy and adolescent punk that would probably sit well in the southeastern regions of Thee Americaland.\u00a0REFRESHING JACKUP are like MINUTEMEN reincarnated as drunks who are into and FYP and can't tell what they want to do - I'm pretty into it. So yeah...dig on some bands you don't know.

A breathy excursion clouded with misty eyes and led by airy vocals intent on complete mesmerization, this release bounces between sweetly innocent and painfully simple moments of emotional exposure to confusing swarms seemingly created for the sole purpose of concealing those very same emotions.

I've posted several here already (yes some of the links are dead, no I'm probably not going to revive them any time soon) but the internet tells me there are still a few more that I need to track down (You Can Be A Victim Of Their Authority and Where Is The Freedom, most specifically). Fantastic blasts of under the radar (mostly later) '80s hardcore and punk, with a possibly inadvertent focus on German, French and English bands. The tracks are typically available on other releases, but it's not like everyone is clamoring to get their hands on the Bloodsucker comp so they can learn about BLOOD AND THUNDER (no need now - \"State Rebel\" is included here) or digging through bargain bins trying to score that elusive DIOXIN 12\" (which is not hard to find...you just aren't looking for it). So log another enthusiastic vote in favor of the format, and check out THE YOB, RUDOLF'S RACHE, DIE FROHLIX, LD 50 and tracks from GENERIC and SHRAPNEL, two bands you're likely already familiar with...and help me track down the other Acts Of Defiance comps, please.\u00a0DO YOU WANT ANOTHER HIROSHIMA? https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2011/09/give-them-love.html"

THE CULT's Love\u00a0hit the shelves in 1985, but Billy Duffy's licks are over these four songs, and it works great with the more melodic (and perhaps slightly over-harmonized) vocals...the guitar break that drops at the 2 minute mark in \"Black & Proud\" is pure fucking magic, and sets the stage for the rest of the demo from a band that should have received far more mainstream accolades than they ever did. \"Time To Decide\" could be a lost track from a John Hughes movie montage - the scene where the kid really comes into his own as a young adult and comes out of the song with the self confidence to really stick it to his detractors and stand up to the cool kids. The UK political punk fury hasn't left the band though, \"All God's Christians\" is a two minute ripper that borders on crossover until the bridge comes in with it's melodic guitar leads (once again: THE CULT and THE ALARM are all over this thing in the guitar department). The demo closes with a quality five minute jam that is transfixing from start to finish, total MOB/ZOUNDS styled dreary UK anarcho with soaring vocals and ethereal guitars. There is virtually no edge to these songs whatsoever, and if I had a complaint that would certainly be it, but I grew up a new waver, and these layers of decidedly untough vocal melodies are suiting me just fine this morning.

That's cool, we are still friends (in the modern, electronic sense of the word at least). But sometimes I just need to sink into something, you know? Sometimes sound is something that is meant to be a part of instead of simply a witness to, and that's how I felt when I heard this tape. And that's how I feel while I'm listening to this tape as I type about this tape. It's subtle and alluring, the embodiment of an aural escape...and every now and then you might need one of those. This 15 some odd minutes came to me as two separate sides of a somewhat damaged cassette - the damages have been preserved but I have squished the sound into one track. Technology.

The Bay Area was prime for shit like this, perhaps a reaction to the impressive array of high profile thrash bands from the region, and bands from here often seem like they have a different edge. Take CHRONIC PLAGUE from Albany (that's near Berkeley, and the town where a relatively well known band from area was formed around the same time this 1986 demo dropped) - first track is really just a crossover thrash screamer, but other shit starts to creep in on \"Disillusioned\" (especially the intro) and these primitive sounding yet quite complex bangers with their crackling guitar and teen frustration make a serious impression even on first listen. Do not expect a produced or polished assault - this is raw and very very real garage thrash. Also, I'm pretty sure the dude playing bass was my roommate in San Francisco ten years after this was recorded.

This band BEARCATS opened the show and as they were doing a quick soundcheck I confess that I was thinking \"what are these kids doing playing this show?\" because it was a bass/drum duo playing really stripped down kinda indie and very amateurish punk(ish). It was endearing - don't get me wrong - it was just pretty far removed from the kinds of bands we typically cross paths with. And then the doors opened and the douchelords and bros started pouring in, and there were the apolitical '80s rejects and there was the dude in the MENTORS shirt (and his girlfriend...also in a MENTORS shirt) and there were sketchballs by the metric ton and I looked at the promoter as BEARCATS started and he just smiled...because he is (apparently) smarter than I thought. It's not just that the band is good (they fukkn are), it's that they are important. Two young women on a stage doing what they do with confidence, doing it on a revered stage and in a place of power...it's important.

I was about to describe CELESTIAL SEWER as the \"latest\" offering but then caught myself because there are probably another half dozen pieces of sonic irreverence waiting in the wings and Down In The Sink is merely the latest offering to reach my grubby (and greedy) little mitts. Teaming up this time with M. Magic (GIRLsERM, LOS PUNK ROCKERS, MOZART, STILLSUIT) and M. Furlong (NASTI), M. Nordile lurches through six pieces of improvisation and/or calculated damage with bass bleating like a lost trombone and Magic's guitar making excruciating sounds that simply defy identification....much less compartmentalization. The constant compulsion to create is a quality that I both share and envy, and barging forward even (especially) when you don't know where you're going helps to blend journey and destination into a froth that seems to go perfectly atop any morning beverage. So drink up (again), my friends.\u00a0DOWN IN THE SINK"

Discovering OCEAN BLUE with Scott Danbom and watching with wonder as this 14 year old (?) kid made music on his then-state of the art keyboard. Driving aimlessly with Chase Valdez in his Karmann Ghia (I think it was orange?) and listening to THE SUNDAYS. Hearing THE PRIMITIVES and trying to convince my pal Dotti that they were great (maybe it worked, but I never sold her on THE PIXIES, she thought \"Monkey Gone To Heaven\" was noisy crap). Making mix tapes for Laurie and hoping to find some CURE b-side or live cut that she hadn't heard before...this was all happening while I was reading No More Censorship inserts in DEAD KENNEDYS records and mail ordering SCREAMING TREES and RUN WESTY RUN records because they were on the same label as MINUTEMEN and H\u00dcSKER D\u00dc. And it was all the same to me. It was all an escape. It was all a connection to worlds outside of our shitty town, and connections to the lifelines that we maintained within it.

If the first release is any indication, then I am absolutely along for the ride. Dosis 6 was one of seven tapes released by DIDAKTISCHE EINHEIT in 1982, a dizzying collection of recordings that blurred divisions between early industrial, Krautrock, no wave and sheer experimentation. \"Fr\u00f6mmigkeit\" is the closest to a jam, a six minute argument presented as a song\u00a0based on one repetitive two note riff and stark vocals coming from all directions, while \"Mutterleib\" is pure demented ABW\u00c4RTS glory and \"E-norm-ton\" is a near 20 minute session well worthy of HAWKWIND comparisons. I've listened to this countless times - it acts as a collection of sounds and a window into a community of musicians and artists that were absolutely a reflection of their time and their place in the world.

But long before that 12\" was released in 1985, DIOXINA were banging out \u00a0skinhead anthems of the highest caliber, most notably on 1983's Skins E Punks = T.N.T. compilation EP, a taped version of which I listened to with wonder for a solid decade before I learned anything more about any of the bands. The two tracks from that comp (including \"Franz,\" an infectious midtempo burner) are featured on this rehearsal recording, and the other eight tracks are just brilliant UK influenced gruff Oi! delivered with pure insistence and barely contained energy. The vocals are appropriately rough, and while this session is quite raw, any nuance lost in the recording is more than compensated for with power. \"Contro Potere\" is screaming, and will power you through all of the rough patches you might encounter today, and the follow up \"Eroina\" throws a drunken ska groove in my face and has me dancing before I even realize what's happened. Would be nice if DIOXINA had left us with more than a 20 songs from their brief run, but I'll take what I can get. DIOXINA Live versions of these tracks can be heard on Escape Is Terminal, originally released as a split with fellow Italian skins ROUGH in 1983. No, I do not have the ROUGH material, but I would certainly like to have it.... //1.bp.blogspot.com/-rwVw7cKZmL0/UVL7io4PhjI/AAAAAAAAHh4/avwd9LxxEEA/s1600/dioxina+copy.jpg http://escapeisterminal.blogspot.com/"

Now, we can debate whether or not you need both versions, but the honest truth is that this CDMX outfit is just so fukkn good that you need to have at least one (for real though, this mix does sound better). Passionate and forceful hardcore, MALCRIA\u00a0always seem like they are on the verge of complete chaos while keeping a dark urgency.

How do you make your bombastic DBeat band stand out? How do you create a light so bright that it will shine through the black clad haze and burn a permanent impression of your creation into the hearts, minds and earholes of all fortunate enough to experience it. Considering the odds, how is this even possible - and what would make someone even try? But people do try, and bands continue to fall in line recycling the same riffs and making sure the EQs on their distortion pedals are set precisely the same as the bands who came before them (and the ones that will come after) to ensure that there is no distinction. No originality. Indeed, no life whatsoever, just passable facsimiles taking up space on shelves and in boxes before they move onto used bins and languish. So the real question is: Why bother? Indeed: why, why - why why why? Because there's a chance. Because you might have the formula tweaked just right, and the conditions might be perfect, and maybe you are the unicorn and your horn with stand tall above the studs and spikes. Of course, it's also possible that you are just that fukkn good, and that your under the radar Four Track Demo from 2015 will slowly and confidently rise to the surface, filtering fury down from the Great White North. Sure, maybe you keep bashing the shit out of that tired ass drum beat because you don't know any better....but maybe you do it because you're driven. Because you need it. Because you're full of fire and if you don't release the energy then you will implode. And so you release it in the most efficient and deadly way possible. NARK\u014cTTA"

The mix is all fukkd up, the components all sound like they were recorded in a basement toilet on a micro-cassette recorded and nothing sounds like it is even supposed to go together. I can't tell if the vocalist is mad at the world or just pissed because the bass guitar is smothered weird sauce and all you can really hear is the unfortunate off time click instead of the low end rumble that might give the recording some power. There are breakdowns....and those are a different story. A story about how JAPANESE FURNACE just doesn't make sense. I mean, it's hardcore to be sure, but I don't think you can set out to make something this demented, and I certainly cannot imagine a band hearing this mix after a recording and thinking \"Yeah, sure....that's what we were going for.

It's the rhythm here - PAX TITANIA kinda throb their way through these two live recordings from 2007/08, venturing into what might (in another world) be a minimal techno set but staying firmly planted in raw, weird, improvisational ambience; so much more trance-like than what likely get's passed of as \"trance\" as a subgenre. The second piece, recorded at the venerable Tampa Noise Fest, is fucking masterful - primitive electronics punctuated by harsh noise that devolves into a series of erratic fits and starts, that then gets absorbed by hard synth driven pulsations...like Peter Shilling finally tracked down ground control, after it was too late.

Musically there are merits; there's some rough and nasty hardcore punk...and I like rough and nasty hardcore punk. There's a SoCal surf/bro tinge masked as tongue-in-cheek dude humor (\"Eating Tacos (With My Vatos)\" as an example) that I can live without, but I was also around in the mid-'90s so I am well aware that this was ubiquitous if not unavoidable, and especially on the West Coast. Most of the lyrics are stupid (I am a bloody stinky punk limey. I don't care about the system especially about your money - I got spikey hair and I'll stick it in your head. I don't even care about your mommy. I play in a punk rock band. - from \"Bloody Punk Rocker\"), but that goes along with the overall but notably less intelligent SOCKEYE vibe and is therefore to be expected. Tracks like \"S.M.D. (Suck My Dick)\" can seriously go fukk themselves, they aren't even funny given the \"context\" of hindsight....but hey: DIY punk in the '90s (insert a shrugging dude emoji here).

And I still like it. From the lazy adolescent \"Soup\" to the blown out (lack of) production and casual chaos of \"1998\" these kids capture a time and a vibe brilliantly. There are a few harsher moments (\"Cadillac\" and the chorus in \"California,\" for example) though for once I think that staying cool and mellow works in their favor.

Their sound quickly progressed from UK influenced punk to metallic punk, and by the early '90s they were basically a metal band, sharing bills with larger metal acts that passed through the region. 1990's Brain Fucked EP from France's New Wave Records is probably the best chance for \"western\" punks to snag physical copies of their releases, most of which are still cassette and CDr demos. This two song teaser might not be the best introduction to the OPPOSITION PARTY, but their version of THE CURE's \"Killing An Arab\" is interesting at the very least, and the other track sounds like a metal band trying to fill a niche between DICKIES and pop music. Seriously. It's weird. And kinda awesome. There are certainly more important recordings by this band (I do not know where or how these songs were released), but it's a good kick in the ass to learn more about things outside of your comfort zone.

Slightly deranged and amateurish, but deeply depressive at the same time. The approach is simple, with wailing tinny guitars dominating the mix while drums bang away in a seemingly aimless manner, struggling to maintain anything resembling a steady rhythm, but that's exactly the appeal of Italy's OVSKUM. By the time the \"blast\" (a generous descriptor) starts near the 5 minute marl of the second track, I had already accepted my fate and was settling into a weird and distant recording, which made that section of the song especially off putting and set me up for the remainder of the tape. OVSKUM has been prolific over the last decade or so, Untitled I was released in 2006. This is far from advanced music, more like an exercise...or perhaps a test.

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on August 25, 2015 Description from Terminal Escape: I first saw MARSHSTEPPER at a place called The Lab in San Francisco a few years ago. I don't remember why I wanted to go to the show, because I didn't really know anything about the band, but I had convinced myself that it was gonna be a thing...so I went. I didn't know anyone there, and it was a big weird open art gallery, so I sat in the corner and drank....and I waited. A long time. And nothing happened. I texted Karoline something to the effect of \"I am an idiot. Why am I waiting for something to happen? There's no way that whatever is going to happen is going to be good enough to justify all this waiting once it actually happens, which might be quite a while from now.\" And still I waited. Alone. I mean, there was one dude that I kinda knew, and we said \"hi\" but that was it because he had actual friends there....and by \"there\" I mean The Lab in San Francisco, where exactly nothing was happening. Apparently there was a fellow from AVON LADIES in the band, because I saw him walk in with some equipment, but we had only met that one time in that really hot warehouse (I mean, most things in Phoenix are hot) so after we said \"hello\" I just kept waiting. I went to the store and bought two beers, drank one of them on the way back from the store and then went inside with the other one....and I waited. Seriously, either I was really early, or the show was really late, because I waited for a long ass time. No way a show could be good enough to justify the waiting, but I kept waiting because of a thing called FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). What if it was really good? What if it was worth the wait? So I waited....and then a band played. By \"band\" I really mean \"dude with a laptop computer and he was called JOCK CLUB and it was pretty cool (actually very cool) so I kept waiting, encouraged by optimism and FOMO. And then it got dark. And there were candles. And there were robes. And there were naked men. And it was transcendent. Perfect. Awesome. Everything I hoped plus so many things that I never dreamed. It was the thing you wait for. It was the thing you are afraid of missing. It was the reason that FOMO exists - because you do not want to miss what I saw. I've tried to see MARSHSTEPPER several times since, and every time something has gotten in the way. I like to think that this is the universe telling me that I saw the perfect show, and that I do not need to see another. Maybe, for once, the universe is right.

The bass is super farty, the mix is all over the place, the vocals can't keep up with the music half of the time and the backing vocals are almost always slightly off, the rack tom fills leading into the chorus of \"Polluted Atmosphere\" are almost comical, the guitars have that inimitable clean/destroyed tone that gets mostly buried by the rhythms section but the solo in \"Insane Brain\" earns full legend status. In other words -\u00a0 this unknown UK thrash screamer from 1985 sounds real. And it's intense as fucking hell. Ten studio tracks, with five live tunes (yeah - they're rough...but you could have figured that) and four more recorded at rehearsal (in case you thought the live recording wasn't quite rough enough) and a \"Paranoid\" cover that makes no sense whatsoever.

Whatever god, friend or band was responsible: Thank you. Five tracks of screaming black death, this is what I wanted VENOM to sound like after I had heard how evil and scary they were...but compared to OLD SKIN, VENOM are little more than glorified candy asses. This is pure filth, and a reminder that sometimes those hairs might be up my ass for a reason. OLD SKIN There is also a current vaguely metalcore band from Manchester called OLD SKIN\u00a0who were kinda decent when I listened to them. And there is also a solo acoustic folks dude from St. Louis who calls himself OLD SKIN, and while I have to admit that the name probably fits the acoustic guy better than the other two.

The band is such a perfect time warp, electro/synth dancefloor bliss with brilliantly robotic vocals...they do absolutely everything right. It's perhaps not hard for bands to simply recreate, but when the bands take the feeling and the energy from bygone eras and long pass\u00e9 subgenres and breathe life into them, make them feel new again? That's something special, and that is what PRESSURES do. So yeah, I was excited. They were slated to play in the small room at Mohawk with a bunch of other not punk at all bands, which suited me fine (I would be seeing a lot of punk bands over this four day event), and their time slot didn't really even conflict with anything else I wanted to see, so boom. Robert wins. I arrived late and missed SURVIVE (which I still lament), but got to see New York band DIIV who, based on preliminary research into this not punk at all gig, seemed to have a few good tracks, and they were really bad. Like, absolutely terrible...but I've committed to spend the evening at the not punk at all show, so fukk it, right? I mean, it's not like I was going to go see MILK MUSIC, so I just stayed and drank - though I admit that I sneaked out to peep a few minutes of the POWER TRIP set (ruled, duh). And then 11:50 had arrived and it was time and I was pumped, I was going to lose my shit and dance my ass off.....and then it was 12:15....and then 12:30, you get the idea. Are you fukkn kidding me? I know there are a lot of things to plug in, but seriously?! It was taking them over an hour to set up four damn keyboards, and there seemed to be zero urgency as they just lolligagged around the stage, drinking, talking, casually plugging in patch cords while I waited. And waited. At a certain point, I started to take it as a personal affront, as if these two men were intentionally ruining my night, making me regret my decision to attend the not punk at all show instead of seeing punk things. Well, PRESSURES, maybe you won that night, because after standing in the back with my thumb up my ass waiting for you to figure out how to make sound come out of your overgrown Casios, I fucking left. I walked two blocks and I saw INSERVIBLES deliver the absolutely punkest set of the entire weekend. They were so punk, and they were so good, and even though it was still early when they were finished, I didn't even bother stopping back by Mohawk to see if you dummies had decided to entertain anyone because I didn't need you anymore. Good tape though, I listen to it often.\u00a0 CASTING SHADOWS //1.bp.blogspot.com/-GbeWL8dwmPI/VYbv2Gi9biI/AAAAAAAAMh0/TFZecTAvxOE/s1600/pressures%2Bcover.jpg"

Sweden's FINAL EXIT is a perfect example; it's boring, derivative and utterly forgettable to me but they are a band that absolutely changed some of my friends' lives. Good for them, and my fault for listening to ERASURE in high school (\"Oh L'Amour\" is a banger, deal with that). But sometimes you can hear the shit years later and you're all like, \"oh dude, I bet this shit was bad ass, I totally get this....wish I had been there, but I'm stoked to try to relive the magic through these recordings.\" So here you go: Brasil. 1996.

I tend to acquire things. Anthropologically speaking, LOW TOLERANCE were a small college town band that seemed to be juggling an array of early '90s influences - primarily late '80s North American punk and an upswell of grunge. They managed to do so and retain a shred of integrity (more than I can say for myself), and at least half of the tracks on this 1993 cassette are objectively decent....and some are pretty good.

While the more visible (audible) scenes in some of the trend setting regions (I'm talking NY and Oakland, really), those influences that would define a band's sound today, might just subtly steer a band's sound in one direction or another. The kids in GORDY likely shared a few East Bay punk tapes, but I'm guessing they were just as enamored with the DIY punk scene in Wisconsin, where they were from. Just some kids, taking a little of this and a little of that from whatever they could get their hands on, and banging out their own kind of punk...because they could. Is \"Cute 'lil Fuckheads\" a good song? Nah, it sucks. What about \"Beautiful Conscience\" or the instrumental ripper \"3 Ninjas\" or the other tracks where GORDY pulls it off? Yeah, those tracks rule. Imagine DAMITOL (Milwaukee) with a less technically proficient SCHLONG...if nothing else, GORDY feels familiar, like you already know them, even though you don't quite know what they're going to do.\u00a0HOODLUM PUNK"

It relieves virtually all of the pressure, removes pesky irritants like outside influence, and opens up the songbook so you can essentially do whatever you want. ZINK TABLETZ was a two-day studio project from upstate New York, and it sounds like they had no qualms about baring their garage rock 'n roll souls while playing killer basement punk. Keyboards on \"Bloodbath At The Disco Prom\" give off a vague SPITS vibe, while the whole thing has an ear to the past that is equally in tune to STOOGES as to the kind of early punk that you hear on those Songs By Bands That Broke Up Before You Knew About Punk compilations. \"Idiot Box\" is a screamingly simplistic banger, and everything else is rough, feisty and very nice.\u00a0 ZINK TABLETZ"

Certainly the effects take precedence over the music for a fair chunk of these songs, but the songs are goods ones that have been tweaked and manipulated instead of drivel that's been coated in cheap makeup.

EYES OF CROW are so brutally simple that you feel like you've heard every song before, and it's that simplicity that makes this demo work. I was fukkn hungry for each track because I knew what was waiting for me, and then \"Katastrofe\" starts and the guitars are buried and it sounds so dark and ominous...like a door is closing. And then it's over. In less than ten minutes, my faith in ramshackle DBeat hardcore - a faith that has never wavered - has been strengthened by a seven year old cassette from Spain.

Disjointed ramblings and questionably tuned everything combine with a carpet bombing of various and sundry sounds and snappy, snotty, fukk you vocals. Tracks like \"Portrait Of The Artist As A Piece Of Shit\" certainly imply these New Orleans mutants are very very aware of what they are doing, and it doesn't make it any less appealing. I can't really picture a band consciously trying to manufacture a SOCKEYE vibe, but this one comes close and adds a stylish erratic swagger (I'm talking about the title track here).

I picked up a few tapes from the locals, tapes they had brought back from a recent tour of Colombia, which sounded amazing. A flight to Bogota takes about as much time as a flight to New York, yet it seems a world away from here. And then after the show I found myself listening to the tapes I got from (SECTA SUICIDA and PESADILLA DISTOPIKA will appear here shortly) and scouring the internet for more information about Colombian punk. Was I sleepy at work the next day? Yes. Did I care? No. Especially not after blasting these 25 searing cuts of distorted raw punk. The sound quality varies quite a bit throughout, and admittedly some of these tracks are best served as a \"this is what they sound like\" as opposed to regular listening, but these are the tapes that keep me excited about punk. The feeling I had Tuesday night is probably as close as you can get in this internet age to the feeling of discovery in the earlier days of punk.

The rest of this volume is certainly up to the challenge, of course, from THE WHISPERS doo-wop waltz to JOHNNY FLAMINGO dropping steelpans and inadvertently fuzzed out keys into the summer cruise. THE DELICATES \"I Want To Get Married\" is another standout, THE DUBS swing hard with \"Could This Be Magic\" and the ultra smooth \"Pledging My Love\" from JOHNNY ACE just oozes. This comps are so much more than \"oldies\" collections (THE MOMENTS' version of \"Love On A Two Way Street\" is only eight years older that Never Mind The Bollocks, after all), these are the soulful secret underbelly of the music industry hitmakers that held a death grip on artists and listeners alike...you can hear a little more grit, you can hear a little more desperation, a little more honesty. LITTLE ANTHONY's \"I'm On The Outside Looking In\" is a perfect example - it simply must have been too real for radio at the time, so it was relegated to bedroom 45s and late night cruises....and you can practically feel his sigh even (or especially) today.\u00a0\"gotta find a way gotta find a way gotta find a way back to your heart babe....\" EAST SIDE STORY vol.6"

You can see punk bands in a boxing gym, you can look at the America that used to be (or perhaps never really was), you can go to a thrift store and then pop across the street to a porno theatre, and you can go to Going Underground and lose hours looking at records. And while you are looking at records, if you are me, you'll probably get distracted by the tapes too - the cover and title alone intrigued me here, and I was prepared to buy blind when the proprietor told me it was a space mix of dancehall and reggae...hmmmm...I don't really give a shit about that shit (it's an apathy born of ignorance, I admit), but when a dude who seems to have impeccable taste presents an hour of faves from relatively foreign genres, then I'm intrigued.\u00a0From the source, this is: \"60 minutes of reggae and dancehall hits taken from my records and space mixed.\" \u00a0I do not know a single artist on this tape, but I found it to be 60 minutes of sheer bliss.\u00a0 SUPERMIX: OK FOR ROCKERS, OK FOR PUNKS This was taken around the corner from Going Underground.

The easy highlight is Lithuania's SC - disjointed punk that seems like perhaps it wants to be metal but doesn't quite pull it off, these songs are well worth the entire cassette and I find myself scouring the internet searching their few cassette only releases (it is so far a fruitless search, but it is not finished). STONEWALL, Portugal's X-ACTO and Brazil's PERSONAL CHOICE fall nicely into the straight edge hardcore box though all write songs more interesting than a generic genre descriptor might suggest. BY ALL MEANS from Modena, Italy were the first band I ever drove on tour back in 1997, and the sonic assault they delivered at those shows has not been lessened by a decade and a half - I still think they are a seriously under appreciated band, pure and personal brutality. MEANSTREAM are gruff heavy hardcore with an affinity for mosh and Mexico's AUTOCONTROL round out the line up. AUTOCONTROL seem to have a criminally limited discography (this cassette and one track on a 1999 compilation LP) but their multi vocal doom tinged metallic crust are also worth the entire cassette, so now you have even more reason to get amongst this...

Talk to teenage Oklahoma Punk Me and tell me that was gonna happen on my 44th birthday and I would laugh in your face. I mean....after I asked you who SUBHUMANS were, because I was (and, let's be honest, still am) clueless. The next morning, I got on an airplane and flew to Missouri and spent a few days with some crazy ass religious cult family that my father had somehow entrenched himself in while I watched the life leave his body. The year that followed has been rather intense, but full of life, full of learning, and full of adventure. My friend Katherine made this tape for me, not knowing the condition I would be in when it reached me, and not knowing the struggles that this reality would throw at me before I even had a chance to sit down and digest the contents. But it's a concept tape....and it's about getting old(er). And whether you are knee deep in the shit or not, it is a brilliant mix. This should come as no surprise, since Katherine is a brilliant woman. A woman full of life and knowledge and experience and wisdom beyond measure, and a woman I am very lucky to call a friend. I confess that it was months before I really spent any time with this tape (I was kinda going through some stuff), but as I listen to today to the deep SABBATH cut \"Never Say Die!\" placed expertly between THE PLUGZ and WIPERS, and I think about myself sitting in that hospital room on my father's birthday watching strangers wipe the piss and shit from his lifeless but still breathing pre-corpse, I'm like....\"yeah, exactly.\" Because the rock keeps turning, whether you and/or yours are still on it or not.\u00a0 GETTING OLD IS NO JOKE I write this in late August, preparing to board a flight for South America (yeah...the posts you've been reading these past days were all prepared earlier, like a fukkn TV dinner - nothing personal, I just had somewhere time specific I needed to be). With any luck, and barring plane crashes and/or hijackings, I will spend my 45th birthday with my pals FLIPOUTAA from Tokyo at their tour final in S\u00e3o Paulo with ULSTER and DER and a host of brilliant bands. And with any luck, that night (this night) will usher in a brilliant year, filled with continued growth and renewed positivity. Also, I can never listen to \"It's Good To Have Met You\" without crying. It's simply not possible.\u00a0 https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yn_F_fCE-Es/WaTB2JxrOvI/AAAAAAAARi8/XBC5N9zCAdYoYb8kAkfPfU14sBpwxohLQCLcBGAs/s1600/Katherine%2Bimg1.jpg https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YBCAAlA4Uco/WaTB7jVUm6I/AAAAAAAARjA/vCvd5QdXSrY1j1Np3i1lUrDnRnWMBUoVACLcBGAs/s1600/Katherine%2Bimg2.jpg"

Not far from the goth punk explosion, but rooted in punk, and with mature guitar work that would not be out of place on an\u00a0INTERPOL\u00a0*gasp*\u00a0record. In fact, \"The Fool\" is exactly the kind of track that makes indie bands like that appeal to me, the bands that make me realize that there are fancy pants wearing 20-somethings that were raised on the same sounds that I was, and have taken those sounds into the mainstream world. But then there are songs like \"Isolation,\" a total punk burner by way of T.S.O.L. or ADOLESCENTS, and then there is the saturated off kilter ambiance of the title track or the COCTEAU TWINS on codeine vibe of \"The Hermit\" that closes the tape.

They hooked up with their pals in FOSSIL FUEL....and pressed record. The result was FOSSIL CUNT - improv grind, inept punk, nonsensical noisecore and offensive adolescent humor set to sound. Worth noting that Matt from FF (and SOCKEYE) was the person who introduced me to AxCx, and the 5346 Song EP was the first noisecore I consciously heard...it was very confusing. There was that one guy with a distro while I lived in Oklahoma who would sling MEAT SHITS tapes but something always seemed sketchy, so I never fucked with him...but I digress.FOSSIL FUEL https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEipt9iOhC8GueE1RrOjgR0CBEeQEJg8OVHqJc9-VpC5ddwDRAqefh2qxLDpFpRMkhEhTfwhyy2WcKRc5whbOZOLBrFUpiRafQ9VdQ4v7jYlBnzVvQetBl8eYcT64qq66wbC2peb6ruSIVuzc0BzFsBPj02RHpx67TRcjnbatWvOaKz6PyEH-8Yi_nEjlA/s1264/Fosil%20C%20outside.jpg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U_Zef_x80g&ab_channel=housepig https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2011/08/fossil-fuel.html https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2020/10/sockeye.html"

This is where I say that the lack of rules and norms (and even division/s?) allowed bands more space for originality. This is where I say that even records that don't necessarily \"hold up\" musically two decades later still resonate because there's an undefinable real-ness that it is quite honestly hard(er) to find today. But....this one holds up. Massive and earnest mid paced ChicagoLand (note: actually Quad Cities - my mistake) hardcore - three tracks released as the Persist EP in 1995.

It's in the stark staccato vocals barks, it's in a smoothed out guitar that sounds almost out of tune, and it's in the deliberate construction of the midpaced songs that they play on this 2016 cassette - the first of two self titled bangers. Sonic images of '80s AustroDeutsch dark DIY punk lurking deep in the shadows, never overpowering KETTENHUND's vision but still refusing to leave this form completely. The vibe on this tape is so overpowering that it took several listens to really let the songs themselves sink in....and I was already more than hooked by the time I got there, making short bursts like \"Dreck\" hit even harder than they would have on a casual listen. It's not about more, kids...it's bout better.\u00a0 KETTENHUND https://kettenhund.bandcamp.com/"

Female vocals, great bass work that drives infectious hooks deep into your subconscious so that tomorrow at work I'll be mentally humming \"Fast & Free\" but I won't know what the song is or where it came from - it will just be in there.

This 2012 compilation teams up artists I already wanted to hear more from (SIOBHAN, LIABLE [whose sounds here are arguably more accessible and digestible than ever, which is strange...but awesome], TOLLUND MEN) with the rudimentary dance sounds of BAD USER EXPERIENCE, the sparse electronic meanderings of CHURCH SHUTTLE, and a stunningly dark churning piece from GLASS PATH. Every time I dig deeper into this world, I just want more. Yesterday I got so sucked in that I put on a FRAMTID record just to make sure I still loved hardcore.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to hit Flower Records in Nakano (a hotbed of weird demos, I snagged the SEX one song banger there in '09), I passed on the handful of rare Japanese tapes I came across (wisely deciding that my Yen would be better spent on records), and cassette culture was a thing of the past before punk culture took hold China or South Korea. I did scoop a couple of Mongolian tapes that will intrigue the open minded and bum out punk purists, but those are for another day. Today you get noisy, raw, disjointed and irreverent Brasilian hardcore dished out by a crew of teenage punks and weirdos in the late '90s. The attitude here can be found in a lot of current Midwest HC rehash, the 6th unnamed track in particular would sit quite nicely amongst the pile of gold currently plopping out of Northwest Indiana's backside.

They toured heavily, if not relentlessly, and their live shows set in front of a wall of televisions were always an intense spectacle. But there was never any hype either from them or surrounding them....they just always were. As if simply because Al and Will had been in ACTS OF SEDITION together it felt like NEGATIVE STANDARDS had just always been there. They were acknowledged, even revered, and they worked their asses off...and then they stopped. A demo, two LPs and a formidable split with WHITEHORSE - then they closed the lid. 2015's Fetters was their final recording, a massive collection of raging crust and black metal riffs and noise/samples and colossal sludge, with Will's voice urging everything ever faster. I confess that I'm almost glad that they were a moment...because it was a really good moment. \u00a0FETTERS Speaking of good moments, I watched Will get married to his partner of ten years last night, and it was fukkn beautiful.\u00a0 https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lJBo-X_wswQ/W53mPC0MgoI/AAAAAAAAT4A/B8lT5mLLiHMUXsfppIZkTMhgW30LcvBSACEwYBhgL/s1600/NegiStand%2Bimg1%2Bcopy.jpg"

I've seen them play punk shows, and they confuse the crowd because the music they deliver is metal. I've seen them play metal shows, and they confuse the crowd because they are punks. But every time I see them they improve, and I've heard their upcoming LP and it is a fucking monster. \u00a0Since this demo, ACEPHALIX has changed line-ups a few times, most notable is the absence of the female vocalist on this recording, but the current roster is more dialed than just about any hardcore/punk/crust band I've ever seen live - these dudes fucking live\u00a0in the studio and it shows. Deeply personal and bitter lyrics (read \"Head Wounds,\" fukkn shit!) that are searching, set to plainly ferocious music that. Last year's EP on Prank\u00a0was a killer, but I was floored when I heard the LP recording...perfect marriage of evil hardcore, MOTORHEAD paced metal and brutal crust and it's still totally addictive. \u00a0I pulled this tape out as soon as I got home, and yeah, it fucking rules too.

On the one hand, 28 Children Songs For Wasted Adults has a touch more structure than the interplanetary outsider punk of the previous tape, but rest assured that ON ON ON are still coming at you from a place you don't understand. Jerky post/art punk that will swing like early B-52S for a minutes and then devolve into CRASS-esque arhythmic marches. Guitar/drums/organ and vocals spitting from all directions with a sharp DeutschPunk tongue, these women grab your attention first, and deal with the nuances later. Simple tracks like \"Lazy\" and \"Die Stanze\" both clock in well under 60 seconds (like most of the songs here) and are act like bridges from one burst of weirdness to the next. Sometimes they might be impossible to groove to, but equally impossible to turn away from. Tongue firmly in cheek and without a hint of pretense, this trio just plopped another winner in your lap.. 28 CHILDREN SONGS FOR WASTED ADULTS Trim Tab Tapes\u00a0does not disappoint, and will happily provide you with physical copies.

Then check MORSE (F) on the flip lumber through \"In The Grass\" and wonder if you are listening to THE B-52's or some outtake from The Sexual Life Of The Savages. MORSE appear to have left us with nothing more than this and one two song demo (also from 2012), while MEAT MIST have been busy little beavers for the last half decade, amassing an impressing (and compelling) disc(tape)ography.

So revel, Portland, revel in the 1-2-1-2 drums and the damaged ass vocals doing battle with themselves while the bass pounds through relentless bouncy eighth notes and the guitar is busy just being punk (listen to the title track, and take notes, it's a perfect punk guitar track). Like, really punk. Short bursts of noise and weirdness to keep you on your toes, but CHEMOS are as straightforward as it comes and still manage to sound like they are from outer space. You know this....you've just never heard it done like this. Perhaps because you've never heard it from the only band in Portland. \"Cleanly\" is the choice cut, but all five are winners.

But like all of those other would-be lazy reviewer, I run the risk of dismissing THE SHRIKE in the process and that would be criminal, as these tracks are absolute killers. The very embodiment of irreverent and snotty punk with an laser focus on A Hook, even (or especially) when the band is fukking your head with bizarro drum patterns and calling you to attention with sharp, barked vocals.

I started Music From The Underground with my pal Jon in 1987 when we were both 15, and for the first year and a half or so we would record the show into cassette during the week so the weekend DJ could just pop it in and fukk off for an hour. We were clueless, the segues were bad, the levels were way off, and many of the songs came from cassettes that I shoplifted from Hasting's (before I worked there, shit got way easier then) and dubbed on my dual cassette cassette boombox before returning them to Hasting's for store credit to buy more tapes. Thing got smoother in 1989 when I was hired onto KLOR as the aforementioned weekend DJ...the quality (and content) of the show improved, it ran from 10-12 Saturday nights, and everything was broadcast live, allowing for real time interaction with the denizens of Ponca City, Oklahoma\u00a0who were spending their weekends cruising Grand Avenue. Of course, there are no recordings of those later episodes, so I offer you this to start your year. It's funny to listen back now, almost 30 years later and feel simultaneously proud and embarrassed, but this show was a hugely important part of my teenage life, and helped to keep my head above water when it seemed that there was literally no hope for an existence outside of that shitty town full of shitty people. Fortunately, however....there was.\u00a0 MUSIC FROM THE UNDERGROUND https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g51591-Activities-Ponca_City_Oklahoma.html"

Following the \"everything louder than everything else\" approach to recording, their already colossal riffs feel kinda like an avalanche when the bottom drops. They added a (third) guitar at the EINOK2 show, and the wall of beef on that stage was imposing before they hit a note...listen to the discordant chugs during \"Baby Worm\" and it won't be hard to imagine how terrifying it was. Squirmy affected vocals veer things from huge to weird...and these tapes are dubbed so hot that it hurts to touch 'em. Plop this band in New York or Toronto or Boston and everyone would be soaking their drawers and humping their legs...that's why the middle of the country rules, punks. BIB As is often the case, the physical cassette manifestation that I try to capture here has a different vibe than the digital version...it's not a better or worse thing, but this is how these punks sold be the tape, so this is how I share it with you, you know?

In addition to countless bands and side projects and zines and drawings and paintings and writings...OFF DA PIGS was a neighborhood band that shouldn't have existed...Matty Luv (HICKEY, FUCKBOYZ, YOGURT) on guitar, Captain Norlon (FAGGZ) on bass, Scottzy (FAGGZ, IDIOTS, FUCKFACE/ARTIMUS PYLE) - everyone was friends and everyone partied together, so why not rock together? But the music was something like the sum of those parts recreated as an adult funk band with drug addled psych-by-way-of-Haight-Street guitars. It was weird, and made weirder by neighborhood dude Big Dog rapping over the whole thing, typically with a small posse of large men in tow. It didn't make any sense....and it was completely logical at the time. I guess maybe one way to casually acknowledge your position and privilege as a first wave gentrifier (arguably second or third wave) is to ask a local dude who grew up in the neighborhood to sing for your band and invite him over to get high, right? There was on 12\" on Probe in 1998 that you can still snag for well under $5....you can hear Big Dog's vocals better on that recording than on this rehearsal tape, but I really feel like Norlon and Scottzy are in the pocket on these songs, and Matty is playing out of his mind leads. Plus, the third track could really just be a funky re-working of a HICKEY track, which is pretty cool.\u00a0 OFF DA PIGS https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Tm1JX154fV0/WzJC_tXcPkI/AAAAAAAATdk/7jKMzM7UvoQL4JxiFT5hEeG664B0vlWDACLcBGAs/s1600/ODP%2Bcover%2Bcopy.jpg"

That vibe continues for the first few songs, but you'll notice this demo start to get...weirder. Spastic blasts, off kilter riffs and you (almost) think you're entering power violence territory on \"Menopoz T\u00fcrkiye\" but then \"Hi\u00e7sin\" drops and you're in this whole different realm of freak punk. Fortunately, there are three songs left and they refuse to reign it back in so you're left with this feeling that maybe PLAID RETINA played a one-off gig in Istanbul after that first EP and planted some seeds that became trees because this shit just sounds way out there. They slam the door shut with \"\u015eehir,\" a sub two minute ripper that's just all over the musical map - blurred riffing and pained high/low vocals and the general feeling that this is the sound of a band who is going to evolve into a grind behemoth but not until they've finished kicking your ass with this song. When sounds develop outside of the trend loop...sounds develop in interesting ways.\u00a0YOUR KINGDOM IS DOOMED"

One time I was in a line outside the show, waiting to get frisked, stubbornly refusing to even attempt to pull some weird \"scene card\" that I probably didn't even (don't even) have to jump the line so I could see the first band....and so I listened to aural strains of VIOLENCE outside the venue instead of seeing them in the flesh. They sounded like a complete mess. And I wish I had tried to pull that card. And these eight minutes is all that is left. Four women. No guitars. Weird and uncomfortable post punk presented as noise punk....yeah, I really wish I had tried to jump the line that night. \"We Want Anarchy\" is fukkn primal, there's just no other way to describe it. It's not \"good\" buy any classical definition, but it's more \"real\" than most of the bullshit that passes as punk in these modern days. Keep it weird, y'all. Keep not giving a fukk.\u00a0 VIOLENCE Also - try searching the internet for a band called VIOLENCE. Seriously. It's fun.\u00a0 https://violence-music.bandcamp.com/track/we-saturate"

                    "Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on February 13, 2019 Description from Terminal Escape: I must be doing something right. A few weeks ago, a fellow who I work with very occasionally but don't really know at all (he appears to be a rocker, but we are essentially on a \"nod of acknowledgement\" basis) walked up to me and asked it I liked black metal. Sure, I said, though it's far from my field of expertise. Cool, he replied, and said he was going to make me a tape. A few days later, I had this in my hand. It only takes a few googles to see that Sweden's WULKANAZ are well established in the kvlt world, and a few tracks into 2018's self titled Wulkanaz\u00a0to realize why. A solo project from Kumulonimbus from TOMHET (I didn't know that), WULKANAZ has been cranking out dark and weird black metal for a decade and it's the emphasis on weird that makes them as compelling as they are. You can get away with things when there's no one else in your band that would be really hard to pull off as a collective, and WULKANAZ's use of ambient noise and primitive recordings that careen wildly through various metal and industrial subgenres is compelling to say the least - take the double shot of \"Det Svultna Gap\" into \"Sti\u00e4rnv\u00e4v\" as an initial example. So yeah....this more or less random dude just walked up to me and gave me a tape because he thought I would like it. That's cool. And I do like it.\u00a0 WULKANAZ It's worth noting that the official cover art to Wulkanaz is decidedly more evil that the images shown here. Dude cut and pasted this shit like a true tape monger, and for that I offer even more appreciation. I have a hope that we never become friends, but continue to exchange tapes. Though I'm really going to have to up my cut and paste game: https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DBxIFdmH9iU/XGQtHZEQRLI/AAAAAAAAUsg/aIQ13t0IYHglQLzv6w6g7RDX2yI98_YIgCLcBGAs/s1600/Wulkanaz%2Binside%2Bcopy.jpg https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tGKWdoEW9FM/XGQtHiPb_KI/AAAAAAAAUs4/8EOWol8JmyQ1xb44yV79ifdok7OtJEOUgCEwYBhgL/s1600/Wulkanaz%2Btape%2Bimg%2Bcopy.jpg"
