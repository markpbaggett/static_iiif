          "Build 1906, razed 1929 to make way for Walton. The Shirley Hotel was constructed to serve as a social and entertainment nucleus for faculty members and guests on campus. The name of the new facility was chosen with a drawing from names submitted by club members. Little Shirley Lomax, the daughter of Professor John A. Lomax of the English Department, was the lucky name and thus was born the Shirley Hotel. The building itself was a large frame structure with a classic columned front. It was owned and operated as a private corporation by faculty members until 1922 at which time the Faculty Club disbanded. The Shirley Hotel and the Shirley Annex which stood just north of it were demolished in 1929 to make the site available for Walton Hall which was built at the location."
