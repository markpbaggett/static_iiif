Army\n\n8 August 1945.\n\nDear Joe --\n\nThis series of five maps is intended to give a general picture of the operations of the 100th Infantry Division in the European Theater of Operations. It is hoped that they will prove to be of interest to the members of the Division, and that they may form the basis for further and more detailed study by the various organizations of the Division. These maps constitute only a graphical representation of the general operations of the Division. It is expected that a comprehensive narrative will also be available in the not-too-distant future. \n\nW. A. Burress\nMajor General, U. S. Army\nCommanding.\n\nP. S. Please file these for my return. They really possess great personal & historic value. Sidney\n\nP. P. S. -- Today I was made a Corporal -- another historic landmark!\n"
